This toolbox provides a compilation of models, tools , approaches and other means for measuring, monitoring and assessing multiple facets of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

It is aimed to help multiple partners in planning and evaluating decisions and policies in a region of interest.

We used as an example the GEO BON-Parks Canada initiative to compile and synthesize knowledge from an array of models, tools, scenarios, assessments and observatories that can be used and/or adapted to understand biodiversity change and ecosystem services assessments in the Hudson James Bay Lowlands (HJBL).

We truly believe that this compilation can be extended and used in other initiatives.
