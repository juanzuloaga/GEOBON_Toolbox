This toolbox provides a compilation of models, tools , approaches and other means for measuring, monitoring and assessing multiple facets of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

It is aimed to help multiple partners in planning and evaluating decisions and policies in a region of interest.

We used as an example the GEO BON-Parks Canada initiative to compile and synthesize knowledge from an array of models, tools, scenarios, assessments and observatories that can be used and/or adapted to understand biodiversity change and ecosystem services assessments in the Hudson James Bay Lowlands (HJBL).

We truly believe that this compilation can be extended and used in other initiatives. 

**What is in the Toolbox?**

Integrating and operationalizing multiple elements from the Toolbox will allow partners working and living in a region evaluating alternative intervention policies and/or management strategies under multiple scenarios to provide relevant and strategic information for decision-making.

Planning

Before you start digging into models, tools and other means, take your time to ask yourself what do you want to accomplish and what you need for that. In this section we provide a preliminary <a href='/Planning_form.html'>Planning Tool Form</a> to:

Set your questions, objective, goals

Select facets of biodiversity

Select ecosystem services to assess

Seletc physicial features you want to evaluate

Select potential scenarios you might want to evaluate

Select models and tools that might help you to respond your questtions and evaluate your scenarios.

Select preliminary data sets you might want to include

Weaving & Observatories

Weaving Multiple Knowledge Systems: Here we provide some fundamental ideas and approaches to help partners <a href='/Weaving.html'>weaving multiple knowledge systems</a> in this endeavor of protecting biodiversity and sustainable managing ecosystems services.

Observatories: It includes global and regional <a href='/Observatories.html'>observatories</a> that can support multiple partners in the region. We encourage partners to identify potential local initiatives that can serve as a local hubs partnering with national and global observatories.

Scenarios

We provide a review of two main <a href='/Scenarios.html'>Scenarios</a> approaches (top-down and bottom-up) that can help partners to describe and assess narratives of possible futures.

Models & Tools

This is a compilation of <a href='/Models & Tools.html'>models and tools</a> to measure or assess some facet of biodiversity, physical features and ecosystem services. Again, it is a growing list and we expect contributions from the GEO BON community.

Data: It includes mainly global and regional data sets that can support biodviersity and ecosystem services modeling and assessment. This is not an exhaustive list of data sets and we expect it will grow with support of the GEO BON community. We also expect national and local partners to contribute and help growing this section. Knowing what type of data and where these data sets are available will facilitate the whole process.

Biophysical features (BFs)

BF-1: Biodiversity.

BF-2: Quantifying carbon storage.

BF-3: Permafrost.

BF-4: Rivers & Basins.

BF-5: Wetlands.

BF-6: Lakes.

Ecosystem services (ESs)

ES-1: Ecosystem services.

Tools for spatial prioritization (Tools-SP)

SP-1: Spatial prioritization

Approaches

Biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services management requires the implementation of multiple approaches to achieve desired goals and targets. However, the integration of multiple models and multiple components from social, economic and biophysical system is a necessity to understand the complexity, interactions and feed backs.

These approaches span from species-specific and area-based approaches to multi-objective and scenario assessments.
