    "text": "In this section we discuss the need and opportunity to weave multiple knowledge systems and provide some inspirational examples that can be used in the implementation and operationalization phase of the conservation action planned for the region.\nWestern Science has produced a rich understanding of how and why biodiversity and ecosystem change is occurring at an unsustainable pace. The implications for society are great and a concerted response is urgent (IPBES 2019). This led to the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the need for national and regional strategies to meet the targets and goals of the framework. The framework places great emphasis on an inclusive approach, the importance of Indigenous and Traditional Knowledge (ITK) and the vital role played by Indigenous peoples in the stewardship of vast areas of the Earth’s terrestrial and marine ecosystems. \nThis recognition, fostering, and understanding of Traditional Knowledge and science is the first step in bridging and weaving knowledge systems. The contribution of ITK is now understood to be essential to achieving desirable futures for nature and people (Jessen et al. 2021, Sidik 2022).\nKnowledge frameworks for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services differ greatly in the role and importance they place on Western Science versus Indigenous science and traditional knowledge. For instance, Mace (2014) in an influential article titled “Whose conservation?” described four phases of the framing and purpose of conservation that shifted over the last fifty years. These shifts mainly relate to how the relationships between people and nature are viewed, with consequences for the science underpinning conservation (Figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prevailing view of conservation has changed several times over the past 50 years. Recent decades have introduced people and nature as coevolving and mutually defining reality and recognizing the knowledge and ecological stewardship of Indigenous and Local communities the world over. As a result multiple knowledge framings coexist today (Source: Mace 2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMace 2014 identified four key phases in the framing of conservation knowledge and action:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNature for itself (1960-1970): “...which prioritizes wilderness and intact natural habitats, generally without people, and has scientific underpinnings from wildlife ecology, natural history, and theoretical ecology...” (Mace 2014). Examples of this type are for example: iconic species (e.g., Caribou) and area-based conservation (e.g., protected areas, KBAs)..\nNature despite people (1980-1990): “...the focus is on threats to species and habitats from humans, and on strategies to reverse or reduce them” (Mace 2014). Some examples include species extinction risk (Species at risk) and habitat loss (Global Forest Watch).\nNature for people (2000-2005): “...nature provides crucial goods and services that are irreplaceable yet have been consistently ignored….” Mace (2005). The work on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was a key driver of the widespread adoption of this way of thinking about the natural environment”. Multiple examples and initiatives have been developed and implemented (e.g., ResNet and Nature’s Contribution to People: Díaz et al. 2018, Braat 2018, Chaplin et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2023, Brauman et al. 2020, Hill et al. 2021).\nPeople and nature: this framework (2010 - ):“...rejects the linear relationship characteristic of” nature for people,” instead envisaging a much more multilayered and multidimensional relationship that is difficult to conceptualize, let alone to measure.” (Mace 2014). \nNone of these framings have been eclipsed which means they are all in active use today. However, recent work has expanded on Mace’s to include multiple partners, and knowledge systems in the co-production of knowledge, management planning, implementation, and evaluation of conservation outcomes (Evans 2021, Williams et al. 2020). Challenges exists to pursue co-production of knowledge (Mervis & Pérez 2024)\n\n\n\n\nContemporary challenges from global to national and local scales include moving from one-way relationships (Western Science to others) to weaving multiple knowledge systems aimed to address multiple issues in complex socioeconomic and diverse biophysical and biocultural regions and contexts (e.g., WEF 2023, Wheeler & Root 2020, McGregor 2021, Enquist et al. 2024). Strengthening Indigenous-led governance and promoting meaningful Indigenous participation and engagement in decision-making and management is an international aspiration worldwide (e.g., Goolmeer et al. 2022, Wilkinson et al. 2020, Tengö et al. 2017, Fernández et a; 2023; Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact et al. 2022), including Canada (Henri et al. 2021, Bowles et al. 2022, TWC). Reconciling conservation and biodiversity goals with Indigenous Peoples land and resources rights is also required in any process that might reach a vision of living in harmony with life on Earth.\nBack to top"

    "section": "2. The conceptual framework",
    "text": "2. The conceptual framework\nWe used the IPBES (2016) conceptual framework that provides guidance for the use of scenarios, models and tools for implementing regional and global assessments, designing policy and management strategies and addressing gaps in data and knowledge relevant to biodiversity and ecosystem services, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above depicts two main elements of the IPBES (2016) conceptual framework: first (left) the role of models and scenarios in linking data and knowledge to policy and decisions making, and secondly (right) a simplified conceptualization of the relationships among components of nature and society. It shows how models and scenarios can mediate the flows of knowledge that guide action in different sectors of the economy for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services and human well-being. Similar conceptualizations in other knowledge systems include ‘living in harmony with nature’ and ‘Mother Earth’, among others. The concepts of ‘nature’, ‘nature’s benefits to people’ and ‘good quality of life’ are inclusive of all these worldviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIPBES 2016 framework: Description of components (models, tools, scenarios, observatories, assessment).\n\n\n\n\n\nScenarios\n“Scenarios capture different policy options being considered by decision makers, which are then translated by models into consequences for nature, nature’s benefits to people and quality of life”. (IPBES 2016). For instance, intervention scenarios evaluate alternative policy or management, contributing to policy design and implementation.\nModels\nModels are used to understand how ecological processes interact and predict how biodiversity, ecosystem services and human wellbeing might change. Models formalize relationships among the elements of complex social-ecological systems. Models are qualitative or quantitative descriptions of key components of a system and relationships between those components. Most models (and most tools) have a very specific focus: the more quantitative and exact they are, the more focused the models/tools are on a specific section of the social-ecological system. “Models can provide a useful means of translating alternative scenarios of drivers or policy interventions into projected consequences for nature and nature’s benefits to people” (IPBES 2016). Species Distribution Models (SDMs) is an example of a model that uses spatial environmental data to make inferences about species’ range limits and habitat suitability. Structural equation models can be used to understand the relationships between biodiversity and wellbeing.\nTools\nA set of workflows and associated algorithms representing models and approaches that perform specific tasks and provide users with quantitative or qualitative outputs, usually spatially and temporally explicit. They work well when they are well maintained and updated regularly for an active user community. InVEST and Bon in A Box are examples of tools that can offer and streamline multiple models.\nWeaving multiple-knowledge systems\nWeaving multiple knowledge systems “refers to a process through which multiple types of knowledge are equitably brought together to enable the reciprocal exchange of understanding for mutual learning and application” (Henri et al. 2021).\nObservatories\nObservatories are multi-partner and multi-actor organizations that gather, curate, and share data and knowledge about the changing state of ecological components of a geographic region. Observatories combine observation technologies to produce standardized variables and indicators of change that can guide investments in conservation action and resource management. GEO BON and the CreeGeo Hub are examples of global and community lead observatories, respectively.\nAssessment\nMultiple partners working together proposed to explore plausible future scenarios to be tested with data and models. The assessment evaluates vulnerabilities and risks for a specific case, such as the HJBL, under different scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe IPBES (2016) report describes the various ways models are used to estimate or project changes in nature and nature’s benefits (ecosystem services) arising from observed or hypothesized changes in drivers, for status-and-trend assessment (depicted in blue-green, see figure below); plausible trajectories of drivers, for exploratory scenario analysis (depicted in red); possible policy interventions, for intervention scenario analysis (depicted in orange); or implemented policy interventions, for ex-post scenario analysis (depicted in purple)."

Although these types of scenarios are proposed under the umbrella of top-down approaches, it can also help participatory scenario planning.\n\nExploratory scenarios examine a range of plausible futures, contributing to high level-level problem identification and agenda setting. For instance, socio-economic scenarios are a common starting point to explore plausible futures for biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being.\nIntervention scenarios evaluate alternative policy or management, contributing to policy design and implementation.

Four types of scenarios are illustrated by graphs of changes in nature and nature’s benefits over time. The four major phases of the policy cycle are indicated by the labels and grey arrows outside the coloured quarters of the circle. In “exploratory scenarios”, the dashed lines represent different plausible futures, often based on storylines. In “target-seeking scenarios” (also known as “normative scenarios”), the diamond represents an agreed-upon future target and the coloured dashed lines indicate scenarios that provide alternative pathways for reaching this target. In “policy-screening scenarios” (also known as “ex-ante scenarios”), the dashed lines represent various policy options under consideration. In “retrospective policy evaluation” (also known as “ex-post evaluation”), the observed trajectory of a policy implemented in the past (solid black line) is compared to scenarios that would have achieved the intended target (dashed line).

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are statistical, correlating spatial distribution (occurrence or abundance data across locations) with environmental and geographic variables (spatial environmental data) describing those locations (see Elith & Leathwick 2009, for a review). SDMs use spatial environmental data to make inferences about species’ range limits and habitat suitability; conceptually they are mapping components of the species’ ecological niche through space and time. These models now hold a prominent place within biodiversity science because computing facilities now allow easy use of spatial data layers (GIS software) and remote sensing products that describe geographic environmental structure can be combined with large data sets of species occupancy (e.g. obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility).\nAn SDM model can be used to predict the species’ distribution across a large geographic extent under different scenarios of environmental (e.g., climate) change. They are widely used in conservation assessments comparing species distributions under different scenarios both in target-seeking and exploratory scenarios (see Scenarios section).\nSDMs have been implemented for multiple purposes including assessing prioritization scenarios to protect biodiversity (Berteaux et al. 2018, Eckert et al. 2023), linking local to regional conservation (Albert et al. 2017, DeLuca et al. 2023), biological invasions (Lezner et al. 2019), impacts on ecosystems and human well-being (Pecl et al. 2017) and evaluating critical habitat for species at risk (Leston et al. 2023), linking biodiversity and ecosystems function (Antunes et al. 2024), among many others.\nMultiple studies have identified climate refugia (Michalak et al. 2018) under multiple climatic scenarios (Stralberg et al. 2018, AdaptWEST) for various taxonomic groups in North America (Stralberg et al. 2017). Conservation strategies (Belote et al. 2017, Ranius et al. 2023) to inform conservation planning (Carroll et al. 2017, Stralberg et al. 2020, Stralberg et al. 2020, Droboski et al. 2021) and the implications for costs and configuration of protecting areas (Lawler et al. 2020) under climate change scenarios have been also evaluated.  \n\nStralberg et al. (2020) developed a conservation ranking map for North America to identify priority areas, including climatic macro-refugia for trees and birds (e.g., Stralberg et al. 2018), microrefugia (using environmental heterogeneity surrogates, that is topography, e.g., Ackerly et al. 2010) and climatic corridors (Carroll et al. 2018, Anderson et al. 2023). Buenafe et al. (2023) applied a climate-smart conservation planning framework that prioritizes the protection of climate refugia.\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/\nApproaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nSDMs - Maxent\nGerstner et al. (2024)\nGalante et al. (2022)\nArce et al. (2023)\n\n\nSDMs - Generalized Linear Models\nNewbold (2018)\n\n\n\nSDMs - Boosted regression trees\nManley et al .

They can be used to model single  (Gould et al. 2019) and multi-species occupancy ( Devarajan et al. 2020). And, OMs have shown some potential of conservation prioritization (e.g., Calderón et al. 2022).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/\nApproaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy Models (OMs)\nGould et al. (2019),\nMacKenzie et al. (2002),\nCalderón et al. 2022,\nRushing et al. 2019,\nDoser et al 2022,\nStewart et al. (2022),\nDevarajan et al. (2020)\nTozer et al. (2020),\nSteenweg et al. (2016),\nWestwood et al. (2020),\nFeldman et al. (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies Trait Models (STMs)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms.

Multiple studies have applied this approach using site species composition data obtained from the Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems (PREDICTS) database. This work repeatedly finds average declines in local diversity, relative abundance and functional group diversity due to human pressures (land use intensity, human density) on land cover (Newbold et al. 2015, 2016). Similar approach was applied to assess the impact of human pressures on genetic diversity (Millette et al. 2019).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/\nApproaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nSite-level biodiversity metrics (e.g., species richness)\nNewbold et al. (2015),\nDaru et al. (2021),\nVilmi et al. (2016),\nSchuetz et al. (2015)\nKenchington et al. (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dissimilarity Models (GDMs)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis class of models analyze and predict spatial patterns of turnover in community composition (beta diversity) across large regions (Ferrier et al. 2007). They have been used for multiple purposes from identifying the potential impact of climate change on composition across Australia (Ferrier et al. 2012) to evaluating future scenarios of LCLUC and Climate Change (Di Marco et al. 2019), identifying high-value biodiversity habitat (Mokany et al. 2020), creating biodiversity surrogates for conservation assessment (Ware et al. 2018), and biodiversity analysis and conservation (Mokany et al. 2022), among many others. Additional approaches to assess patterns and drivers of beta diversity at different spatial scales have been proposed (see He et al. 2023). General dissimilarity models go beyond single species and predict community-level features such as community composition and species turnover or richness (Ferrier & Guisan 2006).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/\nApproaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dissimilarity Models (GDMs)\nFerrier et al. (2007),\nRosauer et al. (2013),\nMokany et al. (2022)\nDi Marco et al. (2019)\nFitzpatrick et al. (2011)\nRobroeck et al. (2017)\nGarner et al. (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessments\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/\nApproaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nIntegrative Assessment Models (IAMs)\nSchipper et al. (2019)\nJanse et al. (2015)\nKuiper et al. (2014)\nSoto-Navarro et al. (2020)\nAlkemade et al. (2009)\nKok et al. (2018)\nKuiper et al. (2014)\n\n\n\nIntegrative Assessment Models (IAMs)\nPurvis et al. (2018)\nMillard et al. (2021),\nNewbold (2018)\nSoto-Navarro et al. (2020)\nValdez et al. (2023)\n\n\n\nSpecies Threat Abatement and Restoration\n\nMair et al. (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Vegetation Models\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are equilibrium process-based models that simulate the potential distribution of generalised types of natural vegetation on the basis of the physiological properties of plant groups, average seasonal climate and hydrological conditions and the direct physiological effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (i.e., increased water-use efficiency by plants). Like Global Climate Models, GVMs are used to understand how climate change will drive changes in the distribution of major plant taxa (e.g., boreal, temperate and tropical forests, grasslands, shrubland, tundra).\n\nLeemieux & Scott (2005) used two GVMs models, BIOME3 (Haxeltine & Prentice 1996) and Mapped Atmosphere Plant Soil System (MAPSS) (Neilson 1995) to project the future equilibrium outcome of vegetation across Canada’s protected area network at the time. They found over 40 percent of Canada’s protected areas are projected to experience a change in biome type as a result of climate change, the results of this study contribute to a growing body of research that questions the capacity of existing protected area networks to fulfil this objective in an era of global climate change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand cover and land use changes models\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of spatially explicit models has been developed to simulate and predict the possible future outcomes of land cover and land use changes. For instance, the CLUE model is a dynamic, spatially explicit, land cover and land use change model used in multiple applications such as deforestation, land degradation, urbanization, land abandonment and integrated assessment of land cover change and urban growth (Zhou et al. 2016), among others. For the conversion of land use and its effects at a small region extent the CLUE-S model has been developed (Gao et al. 2021). The Dyna CLUE integrates demand-driven changes in land area with locally determined conversion processes (Verburg & Overmars, 2009). \nCellular Automata Markov simulation models have been also used to quantitatively simulate and predict land use change  (Kang et al. 2019, Beroho et al. 2023, Leta et al. 2021,Kang et al. 2019, Lu et al. 2019, Debnath et al. 2023, Zhang & Li 2013).\nMore sophisticated models like Future Land Use Simulation model (FLUS, Li et al. 2017,; Zhang et al. 2020) simulate multiple land use scenarios; and the  GMOP-PLUS model which analyzes changes in ecological and economic benefits and carbon emissions by optimizing the quantitative structure and spatial layout of land use in different scenarios (Meng et al. 2023).\nCombining models and their strengths are also usual, for instance Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) is a top-down approach that can solve problems with conflict objectives, however it is not spatially explicit, so it has to be coupled with other models such as, for instance the Dynamic Conversion of Land Use and its Effect (Dyna, Wang et al. 2018).\nMethods to downscaling global land use have also been developed (West et al. 2014, Yourek et al. 2023) to fit in Integrative Assessment Models (IAMs, Pereira et al. 2010, Harfoot et al. 2013).\nHarmonized sets of past and present land cover and land use methods are needed to simulate future scenarios (Hurt et al. 2006, Hurt et al. 2011). Assessing uncertainties in LCLUC projections  (Prestele et al. 2016) is also fundamental for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem change.\n\nSome models (CLIMATESAVE Integrated Assessment Platform, GLOBIO) are used to evaluate multiple drivers of change (LCLUC and CC) that might affect biodiversity and ecosystem services (Veerkamp et al. 2020).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nConversion of Land Use and its Effects\nCLUE model\nCLUE-s: Zhou et al. (2016), Gao et al. (2021)\nDyna CLUE: Verburg and Overmars (2009)\nRakotoarinia et al. (2023)\nEl-Khoury et al. (2014)\n\n\nCellular Automata Markov simulation models\nKang et al. (2019),\nBeroho et al. (2023),\nLeta et al. (2021),\nKang et al. (2019),\nLu et al. (2019),\nDebnath et al. (2023),\nHe et al. (2023),\nYang et al. (2016)\nWang (2012)\n\n\nAgent-based models\nMatthews et al. (2007),\nBartkowski et al (2020)\nMcLane et al. (2011)\nFreeman et al. (2009)\n\n\nFuture Land Use Simulation model (FLUS)\nLi et al. (2017)\nCuellar & Perez (2023)\nZhang et al. (2020)\nXu et al. (2022)\n\n\nPatch-generating land use simulation (PLUS)\nLiang et al. (2021)\nMeng et al. (2023)\nMutale & Qiang (2024)\n\n\n\nMulti-Objective Programming (MOP) model\nShi et al. (2023)\n\n\n\nMOP and Dyna\nWang et al. (2018)\n\n\n\nGlobal models use land cover classes to estimate both past and current changes.\nHurtt et al. (2011),\nWinkler et al. (2021)\n\n\n\nFuture land use changes under multiple Climate SSPs and RCPs scenarios.\nChen et al. (2020)\n\n\n\nLANDIS Forest landscape Model\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating LU & IAMs\nHasegawa et al. (2017)\n\n\n\nGLOBIOM\nSoterroni et al. (2022)\n\n\n\nCAPS\nMeiyappan et al. (2014)\n\n\n\nCLUMondo\nvan Asselen & Verburg (2013)\n\n\n\nGlobal Change Analysis Model GCAM\n\n\n\n\nGLM\nHurt et al. (2006)\n\n\n\nIMAGE\nLetourneau et al. (2012)\nSleeter et al. (2012)\n\n\n\nLandSHIFT\nSchaldach et al. (2011)\n\n\n\nMagPIE\nLotze-Campen et al. (2010)\n\n\n\n\nAwais et al. (2023)\nKrey et al. (2020)\nFricko et al. (2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-to-end ecosystem models (E2E)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese models include multiple biophysical, social and economic components and the full cycle of processes to predict changes in the state of ecosystems in response to multiple drivers and management scenarios (e.g., Cuddington et al. 2013).

    "text": "2. Three approaches for quantifying carbon storage\nHere we present three general approaches for quantifying carbon storage for ecosystem services assessments and show how these three approaches could be adapted to account for peatland carbon dynamics. All these approaches rely on local site-specific field surveys for calibration and validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratify and multiply\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approach relies on first stratifying or partitioning the study area into multiple unique land cover or ecosystem types (Goetz et al. 2009, Sharp et al. 2020, Martínez-López et al. 2019). A reference or average carbon stock value is assigned to each cover type. The area of each cover type is then multiplied by the cover type’s associated reference carbon stock value.\nMany ecosystem service modeling platforms use a Stratify & Multiply approach, including the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services, ARIES (Martínez-López et al. 2019) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, InVEST (Natural Capital Project, 2023). Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys to derive reference carbon stock values and detailed site-specific land cover maps that account for environmental gradients that might influence carbon stock changes (e.g., climate, soil characteristics, species composition, management, degradation, elevation, site history, wetland type, ecozone, etc.).\n\nCarbon emissions can be assessed in a similar way. For example, maps of peatland types can be combined with estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange and Methane emission rates compiled for each peatland type and region (Webster et al. 2018).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Land Surface Model is designed to identify the distribution of permafrost.\nYokohata et al. (2020)"

The Direct Remote Sensing approach captures spatial variability of carbon within land cover classes, which is often missed with the Stratify and Multiply approach. Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys for model calibration and validation as well as local site-specific geospatial layers for covariates (e.g., topography, slope, soil type, wetland type, ecosystem type, soil characteristics, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon stock maps can be differentiated to track changes over time. Another new approach relies on multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate changes in peatland elevation after a wildfire (Reddy et al. 2015). Peatlands are becoming more susceptible to wildfires due to lowering water tables under climate change and development (Turetsky et al. 2015)."

    "text": "Mass balance models\nThe third approach, Mass balance models, accounts for all key carbon pools and flows of carbon between these pools over time (GFOI 2016, Bona et al. 2020). Mass balance models can track changes in carbon due to natural processes such as growth and decay as well as drivers of change including land use, wildfires, water table depth, and permafrost thaw.\nMass balance models are especially useful for understanding peatland carbon dynamics because they can account for the balance between the uptake of carbon and the emission of methane (Bona et al. 2020). Furthermore, these models can track changes in carbon due to increases in peatland disturbances, including droughts, permafrost thaw, and fires under climate change (Bona et al. 2020, Harris et al. 2022). When peatland permafrost thaws, previously frozen carbon can be decomposed, thereby releasing carbon dioxide and methane (Hugelius et al. 2020).\nMany modeling approaches have been implemented to estimate peatland carbon stocks in Canada including (1) the Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) which accounts for wildfire disturbances but currently not permafrost thaw (Bona et al. 2020, although permafrost thaw is currently being implemented), (2) dynamic global ecosystem models that incorporate permafrost dynamics (Chaudhary et al. 2017), and (3) inventory-based models (Hugelius et al. 2020)  that can also account for abrupt permafrost thaw (Turetsky et al. 2020). Best practices include integrating local site-specific field data for calibration and validation as well as remotely sensed data for accurate spatially explicit disturbance detection (e.g., Zhou et al. 2021, Bona et al. 2020, Shaw et al. 2021). :::"

    "text": "In this section we discuss the need and opportunity to weave multiple knowledge systems and provide some inspirational examples that can be used in the implementation and operationalization phase of the conservation action planned for the region.\nWestern Science has produced a rich understanding of how and why biodiversity and ecosystem change is occurring at an unsustainable pace. The implications for society are great and a concerted response is urgent (IPBES 2019). This led to the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the need for national and regional strategies to meet the targets and goals of the framework. The framework places great emphasis on an inclusive approach, the importance of Indigenous and Traditional Knowledge (ITK) and the vital role played by Indigenous peoples in the stewardship of vast areas of the Earth’s terrestrial and marine ecosystems. \nThis recognition, fostering, and understanding of Traditional Knowledge and science is the first step in bridging and weaving knowledge systems. The contribution of ITK is now understood to be essential to achieving desirable futures for nature and people (Jessen et al. 2021, Sidik 2022).\nKnowledge frameworks for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services differ greatly in the role and importance they place on Western Science versus Indigenous science and traditional knowledge. For instance, Mace (2014) in an influential article titled “Whose conservation?” described four phases of the framing and purpose of conservation that shifted over the last fifty years. These shifts mainly relate to how the relationships between people and nature are viewed, with consequences for the science underpinning conservation (Figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prevailing view of conservation has changed several times over the past 50 years. Recent decades have introduced people and nature as coevolving and mutually defining reality and recognizing the knowledge and ecological stewardship of Indigenous and Local communities the world over. As a result multiple knowledge framings coexist today (Source: Mace 2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMace 2014 identified four key phases in the framing of conservation knowledge and action:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNature for itself (1960-1970): “...which prioritizes wilderness and intact natural habitats, generally without people, and has scientific underpinnings from wildlife ecology, natural history, and theoretical ecology...” (Mace 2014). Examples of this type are for example: iconic species (e.g., Caribou) and area-based conservation (e.g., protected areas, KBAs)..\nNature despite people (1980-1990): “...the focus is on threats to species and habitats from humans, and on strategies to reverse or reduce them” (Mace 2014). Some examples include species extinction risk (Species at risk) and habitat loss (Global Forest Watch).\nNature for people (2000-2005): “...nature provides crucial goods and services that are irreplaceable yet have been consistently ignored….” Mace (2005). The work on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was a key driver of the widespread adoption of this way of thinking about the natural environment”. Multiple examples and initiatives have been developed and implemented (e.g., ResNet and Nature’s Contribution to People: Díaz et al. 2018, Braat 2018, Chaplin et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2023, Brauman et al. 2020, Hill et al. 2021).\nPeople and nature: this framework (2010 - ):“...rejects the linear relationship characteristic of” nature for people,” instead envisaging a much more multilayered and multidimensional relationship that is difficult to conceptualize, let alone to measure.” (Mace 2014). \nNone of these framings have been eclipsed which means they are all in active use today. However, recent work has expanded on Mace’s to include multiple partners, and knowledge systems in the co-production of knowledge, management planning, implementation, and evaluation of conservation outcomes (Evans 2021, Williams et al. 2020). Challenges exists to pursue co-production of knowledge (Mervis & Pérez 2024)\n\n\n\n\nContemporary challenges from global to national and local scales include moving from one-way relationships (Western Science to others) to weaving multiple knowledge systems aimed to address multiple issues in complex socioeconomic and diverse biophysical and biocultural regions and contexts (e.g., WEF 2023, Wheeler & Root 2020, McGregor 2021, Enquist et al. 2024). Strengthening Indigenous-led governance and promoting meaningful Indigenous participation and engagement in decision-making and management is an international aspiration worldwide (e.g., Goolmeer et al. 2022, Wilkinson et al. 2020, Tengö et al. 2017, Fernández et a; 2023; Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact et al. 2022), including Canada (Henri et al. 2021, Bowles et al. 2022, TWC). Reconciling conservation and biodiversity goals with Indigenous Peoples land and resources rights is also required in any process that might reach a vision of living in harmony with life on Earth.\nBack to top"

The Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES)tool has also been used by the USGS service. \nBelow we describe the major spatially-explicit ecosystem services platforms (InVEST™, ARIES and Co$tingNature) and the ensemble of carbon storage models as a way to enhance accuracy compared with single models. We also present some case studies highlighting the use of these models and tools for ecosystem services accounting with other spatial prioritization tools such as Marxan and Zonation.\nInVEST™\n“InVEST™ is a suite of free, open-source software models used to map and value the goods and services from nature that sustain and fulfill human life.  If properly managed, ecosystems yield a flow of services that are vital to humanity, including the production of goods (e.g., food), life-support processes (e.g., water purification), and life-fulfilling conditions (e.g., beauty, opportunities for recreation), and the conservation of options (e.g., genetic diversity for future use).” (Natural Capital Project).\nOne of the InVEST models is the Carbon Storage and Sequestration model that incorporates four carbon pools (i.e., aboveground living biomass, belowground living biomass, soil, and dead organic matter) and a land cover map (seehow it works).\nThe Carbon Storage and Sequestration model is a very simple model that maps carbon pools within a land cover map:\nData inputs: Land cover and land use map (LCLU) along with stocks in carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter). \nOutputs: Raster metric (tons per hectare (t/ha))."

Topics to consider when applying models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Multiscale analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?\nProcesses and patterns of ecological systems operate and vary as a function of spatial (extent and resolution) and temporal scale (e.g.,Hewitt et al 2017) and it is expected that the response to multiple anthropogenic drivers also vary in space and time (Bastazini et al. 2021.\nNew sources of data sets, vast amount of data (e.g., remote sensing and citizen science) and the need to evaluate and respond to local and regional realities have accelerated the development of these multiscale spatio-temporal analyses.\nSome evidence\nMultiscale dependance has been documented widely:\n\nBiophysical processes, identify patterns in nature (e.g., Brian & Catford 2023, Mod et al. 2020, Meng et al. 2023, Wand & Loreau 2014, Spake et al. 2020, Leroy et al. 2023).\nBiodiversity patterns (Hulbert & Jetz 2007, Chase et al. 2018, Jarzyna & Jetz 2018).\nInform decision making to secure the provision of ecosystem services (Andersonn et al. 2015, Lindborg et al. 2017, Liu et al. 2017, Raudsepp-Hearne & Peterson 2016, Le Provost et al. 2023).\nProtection of biodiversity (Ekroos et al 2016, Hurlbert & Jetz 2007, Slabbert et al. 2020, Mayor et al. 2015).\nManagement (Ladouceur et al. 2023).\nInvasive alien species (Kotowska et al. 2022).\nEcosystem services (Qin et al. 2023, Liu et al. 2017, Hein et al. 2005,\n\nHow has it been addressed?\nUsing local datasets\nFor instance, Dinerstein et al. (2020), identified global areas providing co-benefits by protecting biodiversity and carbon stocks aimed to secure global climate stability (Global Safety Net, GSN). However, Finkelstein et al. (2023) applied the same approach in Ontario (Canada), using local data sets, and found that “when region-specific data are incorporated, Ontario is even more significant than what is shown in the GSN, especially in terms of carbon stocks in forested and open peatlands.”  Zhu et al. (2021) went further and addressed the issue of spatial scales in Asia, arguing that a “framework should be capable of identifying priorities at each scale (regional, biome, and national)”. They proposed “a stepwise approach based on scalable priorities at regional, biome, and national levels that can complement potential Convention on Biological Diversity targets of protecting 30% land in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.” \nIntegrating multiple knowledge systems\nFire regimes characterization using remote sensing (Hanes et al. 2018, Coops et al. 2018) have been used to inform management activities for government agencies (Erni et al. 2019) and along with Indigenous land stewardship have provided tools to advance proactive fire mitigation (Copes et al. 2022).\nDeveloping multiscale scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches\n\n\n\n\n\nTop-down approaches are driven by policy mandates and/or directives, requiring changes in socioeconomic systems (e.g., SDGs and CBDs goals and targets) and designed to force behavioral change through policy. Top-down approaches are usually the first approximation in model implementation, scenario assessment (e.g., Moss et al. 2010, Meinshause et al. 2020,  and Popp et al. 2017), and tools’ development (e.g., Map of Life, InVEST, GLOBIO-ES). However, there is also growing interest to develop and implement bottom-up approaches (e.g., Wallner et al. 1996), that is those approaches that influence policy through collective behavior (individual actions that can propel massive impact when adopted by communities) and/or motivate research to answer questions at local scales. For instance, GLOBIOM is “used to  analyze the competition for land use between agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy, which are the main land-based production sectors. The model is built following a bottom-up setting based on detailed grid-cell information, providing the biophysical and technical cost information”.\nThere is also growing interest in evaluating top-down approaches with local and regional data sets (Siabi et al. 2023), economic sectors (Calheiros et al. 2023), and integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches (Ding et al. 2022, Eicken et al. 2021) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Integration"

These models might take the form of statistical models or mechanistic models parameterized for key processes.\nProjection: biodiversity projections can evaluate the impact of different future social and economic scenarios on future biodiversity – for instance, how different land use and climate change scenarios might affect future biodiversity loss (e.g., Urban et al. 2022).\nMitigation: projection models can be used to test mitigation options via simulation and also incorporate additional social costs in prioritising mitigation options."

These findings and guidance come from two sources: a workshop held in Montreal in October 2023 whith multiple partners working and living in the HJBL and a literature review.\nWe acknowledge that there may be models, tools, approaches and other means out there that escaped this review, while noting that there are some biophysical components and ecosystem services that were more explored and covered than others.

(IPBES 2016). For instance, intervention scenarios evaluate alternative policy or management, contributing to policy design and implementation.\nModels\nModels are used to understand how ecological processes interact and predict how biodiversity, ecosystem services and human wellbeing might change. Models formalize relationships among the elements of complex social-ecological systems. Models are qualitative or quantitative descriptions of key components of a system and relationships between those components. Most models (and most tools) have a very specific focus: the more quantitative and exact they are, the more focused the models/tools are on a specific section of the social-ecological system. “Models can provide a useful means of translating alternative scenarios of drivers or policy interventions into projected consequences for nature and nature’s benefits to people” (IPBES 2016). Species Distribution Models (SDMs) is an example of a model that uses spatial environmental data to make inferences about species’ range limits and habitat suitability. Structural equation models can be used to understand the relationships between biodiversity and wellbeing.\nTools\nA set of workflows and associated algorithms representing models and approaches that perform specific tasks and provide users with quantitative or qualitative outputs, usually spatially and temporally explicit. They work well when they are well maintained and updated regularly for an active user community. InVEST and Bon in A Box are examples of tools that can offer and streamline multiple models.\nWeaving multiple-knowledge systems\nWeaving multiple knowledge systems “refers to a process through which multiple types of knowledge are equitably brought together to enable the reciprocal exchange of understanding for mutual learning and application” (Henri et al. 2021.)).\nObservatories\nObservatories are multi-partner and multi-actor organizations that gather, curate, and share data and knowledge about the changing state of ecological components of a geographic region. Observatories combine observation technologies to produce standardized variables and indicators of change that can guide investments in conservation action and resource management. GEO BON and the CreeGeo Hub are examples of global and community lead observatories, respectively.\nAssessment\nMultiple partners working together proposed to explore plausible future scenarios to be tested with data and models.

    "text": "2. Braiding and weaving western and Indigenous monitoring of environmental change\nWestern Science approaches complex problems such as climate change by monitoring a relatively small number of variables, such as mean temperatures, emissions of greenhouse gases, or indicators of fire and flood frequency and impacts. By contrast, many indigenous ways of knowing, including those of the Cree, approach these problems with a different strategy—by qualitatively assessing many variables (Peloquin and Berkes 2009). This approach to environmental monitoring is not unique to the Cree and has been observed in other Traditional Knowledge systems, as in Maori ways of ‘eyeballing’ animal abundance (Moller et al. 2004) and Inuit ways of monitoring the health and edibility of their food species (Berkes et al. 2007). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining bridging, braiding and weaving\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigenous science is a distinct, time-tested, and methodological knowledge system that can enhance and complement Western Science. Indigenous science is about the knowledge of the environment and knowledge of the ecosystem that Indigenous Peoples have.\nBridging fosters awareness, understanding, and recognition of Indigenous science as a distinct and equal science to Western Science approaches. Bridging is accomplished through mutual respect, repatriation, relationship building, engagement activities, and the development of learning resources.\nBraiding brings together different ways of knowing and being. This refers to the braiding of Indigenous science and Western Science systems to achieve a holistic understanding of the environment while maintaining the integrity of each knowledge system. Braiding is founded on all the Indigenous science indicators included in the bridging as well as reciprocity, renewal, and mutual learning and collective benefit(s) of science outcomes.\nWeaving is about all of the Indigenous science indicators involved in bridging and braiding as well as the inclusion of self-determined Indigenous methodologies, research paradigms, and worldview. Weaving involves appreciating and applying Indigenous science tools to inform approaches to environmental issues and species management in ways that align with the approaches specified by Indigenous Nations, governments, specific communities and international instruments such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Weaving is the path of Reconciliation.\n(Definitions from the Government of Canada website on Indigenous science).\n\n\n\nLocal and Traditional Knowledge offers rich insights into complex environmental processes, such as disturbance regimes and unpredictable events at different scales (Peloquin and Berkes 2009, Royer et al. 2013).  Cree and western scientific knowledge are complementary, which when braided together provide new insights. Royer et al. (2013) show that by contrasting Cree hunters’ observations with climate data, they were able to identify an increase in fall and winter precipitation that could be causing a weakening of inland ice through a change in its composition (i.e., snow ice instead of congelation ice). Their results suggest that future measurement initiatives should put a stronger emphasis on the indicators the Cree have been observing (e.g., white/black ice thickness, water pockets, water pools) to assure a more comprehensive analysis of changes in local inland ice conditions. This data is also required to define realistic, field-based, numerical thermal models of inland ice cover. In this example, both knowledge systems are braided together, to produce deeper understanding of a complex pattern of change.\nTraditional Knowledge may not have the quantitative tools and approaches used by Western Science and technology, but the environmental monitoring practices of indigenous and rural societies are significant in identifying ways to perceive the continuum of nature holistically. This knowledge is expressed in individual practices encoded in institutional arrangements that include purposeful modification and management of the landscape, resource allocation regimes, religious beliefs, and rituals that invite behaviour that adapt to shifts in the environment (Sayles and Mulrennan 2010, Sayles and Mulrennan 2010).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Monitoring of Canada geese by Cree hunters\n\n\n\n\n\nA particular pertinent example is the way indigenous Cree hunters in James Bay, understand and deal with ecological complexity and variable dynamics of the Canada goose (Branta canadensis, Sorais et al. 2022), and how their understanding of uncertainty and variability of goose migration and abundance shape subsistence activities (Peloquin and Berkes 2009). Ecological understandings of Cree hunters allow them to account for and deal with a very large number of variables at multiple scales. Hunters monitor patterns and processes in their day-to-day activities. The Cree deal with these large year-to-year variability by relying on social memory to construct an understanding of the expected range of observations (e.g., goose hunt success, timing of spring ice break-up). They communicate observations of specific events, with a focus on unusual occurrences and anomalies (e.g., unexpectedly thin and dangerous sea-ice) at a particular time and place, rather than on central measures or averages such as those relied upon by climate and biodiversity change models.\n\n\n\n(Left) Canada geese (Branta canadensis) stage during fall and spring migration to northern latitudes. The geese have been a core part of Cree subsistence hunting for centuries. Right) Categories of factors affecting the goose hunt and how they interact according to Cree hunters (after Peloquin and Berkes 2009).\n\n\nChanges in goose behaviour and availability are perceived by the Cree within a view of their social–ecological system that could be described as a complex and dynamic web of interactions. Complexity is one of the metaphors used by some Western scientists to explain ecological phenomena that have challenged reductionist explanations in science. Complexity thinking is one approach emerging from western thought that allows consideration of and discussion on phenomena that transcend analytical/reductionist models of conventional science and opens a door to a weaving of knowledge systems to understand open-ended ecological change in the HJBL.\n\n\n\nBack to top"

Two-eyed seeing offers a practical way to bridge Western Science and Traditional Knowledge systems by providing strategies for checking the accuracy and filling in the gaps of each, without one knowledge system subsuming the other. Two-eyed seeing is thus one ‘functioning mechanism for legitimate, transparent, and constructive ways of creating synergies across [the] knowledge systems’ (Tengö et al. 2014, p. 579), while the integrity of each is maintained. The study by Abu et al. (2019) used a two-eyed seeing approach to assess signals of long-term ecological and biophysical change in the Saskatchewan River Delta.

    "text": "4. Understanding knowledge weaving\n“Braiding Indigenous Science and Western Science is a metaphor used to establish a particular relationship, an obligation of sorts to give, to receive, and to reciprocate. We braid cedar bark to make beautiful baskets, bracelets, and blankets. When braiding hair, kindness and love can flow between the braids. Linked by braiding, there is a certain reciprocity amongst strands, all the strands hold together. Each strand remains a separate entity, a certain tension is required, but all strands come together to form the whole. When we braid Indigenous Science (IS) with Western Science (WS) we acknowledge that both ways of knowing are legitimate forms of knowledge. For Indigenous peoples, Indigenous Knowledge (Indigenous Science) is a gift. It cannot be simply bought and sold. Certain obligations are attached. The more something is shared, the greater becomes its value.”\n\nThe desire to tackle this duality and weave multiple knowledge systems has been materialized in global, national and local policy initiatives (Kimmerer & Artelle 2024; e.g., The Center for Braiding Indigenous Knowledge and Science in the US).\nFor instance, Tengö et al. (2017) provided guidance on how to weave multiple knowledge systems in international science-policy such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), suggesting five main task to enable bridging knowledge systems, as follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive main task to enable bridging knowledge systems (next bullets from Tengö et al. (2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobilise means to bring out and articulate knowledge into a form that can be shared with others.\nTranslate implies interactions between knowledge systems, indicated by the dotted lines, to enable mutual comprehension of the shared knowledge.\nNegotiate means joint assessment of convergence, divergence, and conflicts across knowledge contributions, illustrated here by the combination of some coloured strands (convergence), whereas others may remain contradictory.\nSynthesise concerns shaping a broadly accepted common knowledge that maintains the integrity of each knowledge system, illustrated here by braided strands, rather than ‘integrating’ into one knowledge system.\nApply emphasizes knowledge usable for decision making for all actors involved, at different scales, that can feed back into the respective knowledge system, represented here by multiple braids.\n\n\n\n\nTengö et al. (2017) proposed five main activities that enable bridging knowledge systems. These recognize the different elements of work needed to weave multiple knowledge systems in international science-policy such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). These activities can be applied for national and regional initiatives. Image from Tengö et al. (2017).\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective engagement of actors, institutions and knowledge-sharing processes is crucial in each of these tasks. Rathwell et al. (2015) presented four settings that can facilitate the bridging of knowledge systems: the epistemological arena; methods and processes; brokerage mechanisms; and governance/institutional arrangements. These four settings should all contribute to national and regional initiatives for identifying and framing conservation action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of weaving multiple knowledge systems in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services\n\n\n\n\n\n- Reconciling multiple views (e.g., Indigenous people view themselves as part of the ecosystem they live in, not an external feature, Normyle et al. 2022.)).\n- Promoting Indigenous research leadership (Latulippe & Klenk 2020).\n- An approach to support Indigenous and Local Knowledge and IPBES assessment (Hill et al. 2020).\n- Participatory mapping as an effective spatial explicit tool for conservation planning and management (e.g., Andrade et al. 2021,Chick and Lawrence 2014, Parmesan et al. 2022, Molnar et al. 2021).\n- Indigenous youth must be at the forefront of management, decision-making, policy, etc, (e.g., Olawunmi et al. 2023).\n- “Determining when Indigenous ecological knowledge and o Western scientific data are complementary or reach common conclusions may allow Indigenous communities to use both together, or one knowledge type over another when either is more desired, appropriate, or time- or cost-efficient to adopt.” (Bowles et al. 2022).\n- The Importance of Indigenous Knowledge in Curbing the Loss of Language and Biodiversity (Wilder et al. 2016)\n- Exploring the intersection of Indigenous knowledge and other disciplines  such as ethnobiology (Turner et al. 2022, Molnár et al. 2023).\n- Weaving multiple knowledge systems through land-based field courses (Jacobs et al. 2021) and others (Royal Roads University).\n- Alexander et al. (2021) compiled more than 70 case studies bridging Indigenous and science-based knowledge in coastal and marine research and management in Canada.  They concluded that:\n- “There is the need to consider in more detail how Indigenous knowledge and science can be respectively bridged, but also recognize the specific place-based needs of Indigenous communities.\n-  the need to better report the demographics of knowledge holders\n- numerous methodologies and methods that can be employed by those working to bridge knowledge systems.” \n- Co-production of knowledge reveals loss of Indigenous hunting opportunities in the face of accelerating Arctic climate change (Hauser et al 2021).\nOur Knowledge Our Way Guidelines\nIn partnership with CSIRO, the North Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Alliance (NAILSMA), and with support from the Australian Committee of the IUCN, we answered a call from the Indigenous-majority Project Steering Group to develop a set of Best Practice Guidelines for working with Indigenous knowledge in land and sea management that would:\n-Empower Indigenous people to look after Country ‘our way’.\n-Improve environmental conditions and recognise the multiple social, cultural and economic benefits that come from effective Indigenous adaptive management of Country.\n\n\n\nBack to top"

    "text": "5. Relational place-based solutions for environmental policy\nMost human impacts on biodiversity are viewed as threats, despite large fractions of Earth’s land and waters being home to Indigenous and local peoples who have actively created and managed them for millennia. This ignorance pervades so deeply within conservation discourse that it overlooks the fact that many of these “high-value” biodiverse landscapes are the historical product of, and thus require, human intervention to maintain the very values for which they are lauded (Fletcher et al. 2021). In the HJBL we see impacts arising from the threat of climate change or projected impacts of mining and other forms of development, but we must not ignore the reciprocity between the flora and fauna and the activities and livelihoods of the Indigenous communities living on the lands and waters.\nDespite calls to decolonize conservation and decades of critical engagement by Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars, contemporary Western conservation paradigms (Mace 2014) and practice continues to downplay reciprocity between humans and the ecological world around us. Many major conservation programs and interventions still frame action in the form of subordinating relationships between those who govern landscapes and those peoples governed in them and their culture, knowledge, livelihoods, and environmental impacts (Fletcher et al. 2021).\nTo address this deep misalignment, Kobluk et al. (2024) argued for a return to place-based approaches that are empowered by Indigenous governance and knowledge systems. Traditional Knowledge systems recognize spatially explicit reciprocal relationships among all living and nonliving things, including people, and the responsibility to steward them (Figure below). For example, governance principles, such as hišuk mah c̓ awaak, recognize food web dynamics that link species and habitats, which accommodate and, in many cases depend on, cultural practices of harvest and stewardship by people (Fletcher et al. 2021). These relationships arise from specific places and have coevolved over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental management and conservation approaches. (A) Centralized decision-making by dominant siloed institutions that, in Canada, are structured around industries and/or user groups, removed from place, and managed by different levels of government under distinct laws and policies (shown by silos) regularly leading to policy mismatches. (B) Place-based management that reflects reciprocal social-ecological relationships (yellow broken lines) unique to place, relies on multiple knowledge systems, and where decision-making power is devolved to place. While each place is visualized separately, social-ecological relationships extend across multiple scales/ecosystems. (Source: Kobluk et al. (2024))\n\n\n\n\nIn these Indigenous-led examples, people are intentionally engaged in maintaining social-ecological relationships in place, which is reflective of the relational worldviews of each respective Indigenous\nPeople and their place-specific knowledge. Each case reasserts the idea that desired outcomes for all living things, including people, derive from a larger system of persistent and resilient relationships. Therefore, management objectives consider the system as a whole, including multiple social, cultural, and ecological outcomes and the functional role of people in achieving them.\nMoreover, desired outcomes are not targets and quotas for the biomass of geese, moose, and fish, but rather the persistence of reciprocal relationships among all components of nature, including people.\nRestoring the authority of Indigenous Peoples to manage relationships within landscapes according to their values, laws, and cultural practices is an important pathway to avert the negative consequences of policy misalignments, and to challenge existing systems that continue to fail to address linked social and ecological crises. The challenge of combining local knowledge and government science and reconciling bottom-up and top-down approaches requires designing cross-scale management systems (Elmqvist et al. 2004).  \nAs Kobluk et al. (2024) concluded “It may not be easy, but the restoration of place-based, Indigenous governance will leave us better poised to meet the interwoven goals of biodiversity conservation, social equity, and environmental justice for which we are legally and morally accountable”."

Community Based Monitoring and Traditional Knowledge\nCommunity based monitoring and information systems are contributing significantly to our understanding of biodiversity change worldwide (Ferrari et al. 2015). Community Based Monitoring and Traditional Knowledge as follows (Quiah 2023):\n“Community-based monitoring (CBM) is a participatory approach that involves the active engagement of local communities in the monitoring and management of their natural resources. It recognizes the invaluableness of local communities in conserving and sustainably using their ecosystems, and it leverages their traditional knowledge to inform decision-making processes.”\nTraditional knowledge refers to the knowledge, practices, and beliefs passed down through generations within a community. It encompasses a deep understanding of local ecosystems, biodiversity, and the interdependencies between human well-being and the environment. Traditional knowledge often includes observations, techniques, and rituals that have proven effective in managing and preserving natural resources over time. For instance, Flood et al. (2021) in Ireland used deep mapping values of peatlands for valuing temporal dimensions of cultural ecosystem services to incorporate the dynamic and evolving nature of people’s relationships with natural environments.\nWhen combined, community-based monitoring and traditional knowledge create a powerful tool for sustainable resource management. By involving local communities in the monitoring process (Danielsen et al. 2021). CBM ensures that their perspectives and insights are enlightened in data collection, analysis, and interpretation, which enhances their ownership and commitment to the management of their resources. Johnson et al. (2021) have shown multiple examples of how the use of digital platforms have improved data management in community-based monitoring programs.\nTraditional knowledge complements scientific data and provides additional insights into ecosystem dynamics. It can reveal long-term trends and local indicators of environmental change that may be overlooked by scientific methods alone. Integrating traditional knowledge with scientific data allows for a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystems and their resilience in the developing effective conservation strategies.”\nThis section is under construction!\nWeaving multiple knowledge systems impliesleveraging some community based opportunities (Esmail et al 2023) and maximizing the mutual benefits of cooperation by integrating multiple strategies (O’Bryan et al 2023).\nBack to top"

Although these types of scenarios are proposed under the umbrella of top-down approaches, it can also help participatory scenario planning.\n\nExploratory scenarios examine a range of plausible futures, contributing to high level-level problem identification and agenda setting. For instance, socio-economic scenarios are a common starting point to explore plausible futures for biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being.\nIntervention scenarios evaluate alternative policy or management, contributing to policy design and implementation. There are two classes of intervention scenario:\n\nTarget-seeking scenarios: there is agreement on a common target but there are alternative pathways to get there  (e.g., exploring structural changes in production and consumption to reduce biodiversity loss, Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency 2010).\nPolicy-screening scenarios: evaluate several available policy instruments in moving towards specific targets or goals.\n\nRetrospective policy evaluation (also known as “ex-post evaluation”), the  observed trajectory of a policy implemented in the past is compared to scenarios  that would have achieved the intended target.\n\nNote: The Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium has coordinated several processes to collect quantitative integrated assessment scenarios from the research community.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe roles played by different types of scenarios corresponding to the major phases of the science-policy cycle. Four types of scenarios are illustrated by graphs of changes in nature and nature’s benefits over time. The four major phases of the policy cycle are indicated by the labels and grey arrows outside the coloured quarters of the circle. In “exploratory scenarios”, the dashed lines represent different plausible futures, often based on storylines. In “target-seeking scenarios” (also known as “normative scenarios”), the diamond represents an agreed-upon future target and the coloured dashed lines indicate scenarios that provide alternative pathways for reaching this target. In “policy-screening scenarios” (also known as “ex-ante scenarios”), the dashed lines represent various policy options under consideration. In “retrospective policy evaluation” (also known as “ex-post evaluation”), the observed trajectory of a policy implemented in the past (solid black line) is compared to scenarios that would have achieved the intended target (dashed line).

Exploratory scenarios\n“Exploratory scenarios” examine a range of plausible futures, contributing to high level-level problem identification and agenda setting. For instance, socio-economic scenarios are a common starting point to explore plausible futures for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being (Table below). \nGlobal Socio-Economic Scenarios.\n\n\n\nName\nScenarios\n\n\nShare Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs, IPCC 2021, see also description here)\nShare Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)\n\nSSP1.

SSPs include a range of scenarios drivers such as population, economic growth and urbanization, further use to develop integrated scenarios (baseline and mitigation), including energy systems, land-use change (Popp et al. 2017), air pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric concentrations (Riahi et al. 2017). Within these, SSP 2 “Middle of the Road” SSP 2 describes a world in which the human population peaks at 9.4 billion by 2070 and economic growth is moderate and uneven, while globalization continues with slow socio-economic convergence between countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow biodiversity has been assessed within global scenarios?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControlling future changes of land use\nRecent research has used SSPs as a basis to assess single action vs. combined action scenarios for biodiversity recovery in the coming century (Leclère et al. 2020). Leclère et al. (2020) found that global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion could be reversed if action was immediate, and of unprecedented ambition and coordination. This would be possible while still being consistent with the broader sustainability agenda, such as provisioning the food for the growing human population. The trends varied across the six biodiversity indicators they chose that were selected for their ability to project biodiversity metrics regionally and globally under various scenarios of spatially explicit future changes in land use. Their projections considered only the effect of future changes in land use, and did not account for future changes in other threats to biodiversity (for example, climate change, biological invasions or hunting).\nIntegrating regional climate change-biodiversity feedbacks\nRecent research calls for more realistic scenarios that integrate regional climate change-biodiversity feedbacks (Cabral et al. 2023). One recent example is provided by Mori et al. (2021) who assessed the benefits of climate mitigation on global tree biodiversity (persistence and changes in distribution due to range shifts), and the benefits this would have for diversity dependent primary productivity and carbon storage by forests. They found that, in many biomes, climate change mitigation could substantially reduce the global loss of tree diversity that would otherwise be expected to result from an unabated climate change. This, in turn, is expected to reduce the loss of productivity that would otherwise be expected to result from biodiversity loss. Climate change mitigation is estimated to curtail productivity losses by approximately 9–39% compared with the baseline scenario of unabated warming. The alleviated loss of tree diversity and the resultant conservation of biodiversity-dependent productivity are especially substantial in colder and drier biomes compared with warmer and wetter biomes, probably because species in these biomes are often close to the edge of their climatic niche.\nReducing the adverse impacts of climate change on species in ecosystems is important, as they serve as a massive sink and storehouse of carbon, thereby contributing to climate stabilization (the desirable pathway to stabilizing feedback between climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. This scenario analysis reveals a triple win for climate, nature, and society by simultaneously protecting and leveraging the ecosystem benefits contributed by the biodiversity of the world’s forests.\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n3.2. Target seeking scenarios\nGlobal commitments to the GBF to protect 30% of land by 2030 present an opportunity to slow rates of biodiversity loss by protecting critical habitat and reducing extinction risk. Let’s see a couple of examples in this direction.\nThis section is under construction!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating 30 x 30 conservation Scenarios for Canada\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEckert et al. (2023) explored a range of 30×30 conservation scenarios for Canada that varied the dimension of biodiversity prioritized (i.e. taxonomic groups, species-at-risk, biodiversity facets) and how protection is coordinated (transnational, national, or regional approaches) to test which decisions influence our ability to capture biodiversity in spatial planning. \nThey evaluated how well each scenario captures biodiversity using scalable indicators while accounting for climate change, data bias, and uncertainty. They used spatial prioritization to test whether prioritizing different dimensions of biodiversity versus prioritizing at different spatial scales matters more for 30×30 biodiversity outcomes (Figure below). \nThey first built species distribution models to project the current and future ranges of all Canadian terrestrial vertebrates, plants, and butterflies. To incorporate climate change, they down-weighted future projections to account for uncertainty and to prioritize “win-win” areas of overlap between current and future ranges. Next, they designed 30×30 expansion scenarios that varied the dimension of biodiversity (i.e., taxa, species at-risk, facets) to be prioritized and how well protection is coordinated spatially. Finally, to evaluate spatial prioritization scenarios, they quantify both the amount of biodiversity captured using weighted endemism as well as the number of species protected based on a modified Species Protection Index (SPI), where a species is considered protected when it reaches or exceeds its species-specific conservation target.\n\n\n\nConceptual workflow of methods used by Eckert et al. (2023) to prioritize protected areas in Canada to reach 30% by 2030 under different scenarios.\n\n\nThey found that only 15% of all terrestrial vertebrates, plants, and butterflies (representing only 6.6% of species-at-risk) are adequately represented in existing protected land in Canada. However, a nationally coordinated approach to 30×30 could protect 65% of all species representing 40% of all species-at-risk. How protection is coordinated has the largest impact, with regional approaches protecting up to 38% fewer species and 65% fewer species-at-risk, while the choice of biodiversity incurs much smaller trade-offs. These results demonstrate the potential of 30×30 planning in Canada while highlighting the critical importance of biodiversity-informed national strategies (Figure below).\n\n\n\n(a) Spatial priorities for the optimal National scenario as well as the Transnational, Provinces & Territories, and Ecozones scenarios are highlighted in color based on their priority rank. (b) These shifting spatial priorities incurred high trade-offs across all elements of biodiversity. Trade-offs represent the loss of potential protection from the optimal national scenario. Trade-offs are calculated as the percentage difference between the amount of protection achieved by the alternative scenario and the amount of protection possible under the National scenario. For example, if the National scenario protects 80 species but the alternative scenario only protects 40 species, then the trade-off is −50% since the alternative scenario protects half as many species (from Eckert et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial prioritization for Quebec, Canada\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same analyses were applied to Quebec (Eckert et al. 2023b) in an analysis for the MELCCFP of the Quebec government. At the provincial level, spatial priorities for biodiversity can be clustered into four main geographic groups, although there are areas of high priority across the province (Figure below). High priority clusters include the southern region of the province including parts of Les Appalaches, Basses-terres du Saint-Laurent, Les Laurentides méridionales, Basses-terres de l’Abitibi as well as the area around Lac Saint Jean (Graben du Saguenay), the northern region including parts of Monts de Puvirnituq, Plateau de Salluit, Basses-terres de Puvirnituq, and Monts Torngat, and a mid-latitude region encompassing parts of Plateau de la Sainte-Marguerite and Massif du lac Magpie. These high priority areas contain a disproportionate amount of biodiversity and the establishment of new protected land in the identified 30x30 priority areas could enable the adequate protection of over 45% of Québec’s species. Furthermore, the expansion of protected land in these high priority areas could confer adequate protection for ~30% of all at- risk species, species which are largely under protected by existing protected areas. This represents a substantial gain from Québec’s current state of biodiversity conservation.\n\n\n\nFull rank map for Québec spatial prioritization with continuous cell ranking based on priority. Insets highlight different potential conservation corridors that capture areas of high biodiversity as potential candidate protected areas for protection. Image from Eckert et al. (2023b). Inset 1 includes areas on the eastern shore of James Bay (Basse-Terre du lac Duncan).\n\n\nGiven the predicted high impact of climate change on species ranges in Québec, the observed difference in current and future spatial priorities is expected (Figure below).\n\n\n\nCombined (left), only current (middle) and only future (right) 2030 spatial priorities for Québec’s biodiversity produced by only using current or future species ranges as input into Zonation 5. Image from Eckert et al. 2023b.\n\n\nFuture priorities under climate change tend to shift northward towards cooler regions where Québec’s biodiversity is expected to shift into. Low-latitude priority regions are still high priority areas in future scenarios given the extremely high species richness in southern Québec ecosystems and the persistence of that richness into the future despite climate change. We see areas on the east coast of James Bay come out as high and highest priority in all three scenarios (Figure below).\n\n\n\nNational (federal) priority rank map for the Hudson Bay-James Bay Lowlands based on prioritization of all species (terrestrial vertebrates, plants, butterflies).

While large-scale/global scenarios provide good general guidance, and may help elicit some underlying linkages between social, demographic and economic features on the one side and ecosystem level changes on the other side, small-scale/local scenarios can be very useful for exploring possible futures at the community level. Participatory scenarios usually involve selected local or regional actors, recognized representatives of communities, and members with a certain expertise. They are most valuable for supporting community involvement, enabling local stewardship, and giving communities an opportunity to contribute to setting their own targets and imagine their own futures in view of conservation issues, local livelihoods and national policies.\nBack to top"

    "text": "5. Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Scenarios\nThis section is under construction!\nGlobal biodiversity scenarios (see Ferrier et al. 2016) are difficult to identify and are usually built using direct drivers of ecosystem change such as Climate Change (CC) and Land-Cover and Land-Use Change (LCLUC, see Titeux et al. 2016), known as model-based biodiversity scenarios (Pereira et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2018). For instance, Kim et al. (2018) argue that the role nature and biodiversity-specific policies in scenario storylines are limited, as follow: “...coarse spatial resolution, and land-use classes that are not sufficiently detailed to fully capture the response of biodiversity to land-use change”. This is exacerbated by the heterogeneity of models and their methodological approaches and the lack of harmonized metrics of biodiversity and ecosystem services (except for the global Land-Use Harmonization (LUH) project see Hurtt et al. 2020).\nEcosystem services scenarios (ESSs) are even more difficult to construct and have been explored under the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 scenarios (Bennett et al. 2005). Thus, challenges remain in developing relevant global scenarios for biodiversity (Maurin et al. 2022) and ecosystem services (Rosa et al. 2019.)), although some initiatives have emerged to co-create positive futures for nature and people (Lundquist et al. 2021, IPBES 2023, Kim et al. 2023, Sarkki et al. 2023, O’Connor et al. 2021).\nIntercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (SSPs and RCPs; two major drivers: land use and climate, Kim et al. 2018) have shown important limitations to overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected outcomes from scenarios depend strongly on the choice of biodiversity model used\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjected outcomes for biodiversity under different scenarios depend not only on the social and economic scenario but also on the choice of climate scenario and the type of biodiversity model used to project change (Thuiller et al. 2019). Biodiversity scenarios are not meant to predict the future state of a biodiversity variable precisely, but rather to project the range of possible futures to better understand uncertainties and alternative expectations for the future. \nAccounting for climate scenarios, representative concentration pathways (e.g., RCPs), along with land-use scenarios, allows for an assessment of biodiversity change under a wide range of possible futures. Thuiller et al. (2019) stressed the importance of the choice of biodiversity models. There are different types of biodiversity models to consider, but statistical Species Distribution Models (SDMs), are particularly widespread. Thuiller et al. (2019) found that different algorithms could lead to substantial variability in expected outcomes and the uncertainty associated with them, which may override even the choice of RCPs. This issue was long recognized in climate sciences where it is no longer appropriate to show projected climatic trends from a single Global Climate Model (GCM). Rather, ensembles of climate trajectories are provided to users for scenario comparison via data portals (e.g., CMIP5). \nThe biodiversity modelling community needs to report and communicate the variability resulting from the different options in biodiversity models (e.g. SDMs, dispersal scenarios) and scenario-derived input data (e.g., RCP). Thuiller et al. (2019) urged that variabilities originating from modelling algorithms, input data, and external forces be assessed and reported for better to strengthen the science and improve the confidence in the scenario-based findings for decision-makers in exploring options for conservation action (e.g., placement of in situ measure and protected areas."

    "text": "Models for speciesModels for Ecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies Distribution Models (SDMs)\n\n\n\n\n\nMost questions focused on the shifting distribution of biodiversity cannot be answered experimentally, because many important environmental drivers and biological constraints operate at large spatiotemporal scales. \nModels for biodiversity can describe geographic patterns in the distribution of individual species and the spatial turnover in the composition of multiple species. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are statistical, correlating spatial distribution (occurrence or abundance data across locations) with environmental and geographic variables (spatial environmental data) describing those locations (see Elith & Leathwick 2009, for a review). SDMs use spatial environmental data to make inferences about species' range limits and habitat suitability; conceptually they are mapping components of the species' ecological niche through space and time. These models now hold a prominent place within biodiversity science because computing facilities now allow easy use of spatial data layers (GIS software) and remote sensing products that describe geographic environmental structure can be combined with large data sets of species occupancy (e.g. obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility).\nAn SDM model can be used to predict the species' distribution across a large geographic extent under different scenarios of environmental (e.g., climate) change. They are widely used in conservation assessments comparing species distributions under different scenarios both in target-seeking and exploratory scenarios (see Scenarios section).\nSDMs have been implemented for multiple purposes including assessing prioritization scenarios to protect biodiversity (Berteaux et al. 2018, Eckert et al. 2023), linking local to regional conservation (Albert et al. 2017, DeLuca et al. 2023), biological invasions (Lezner et al. 2019), impacts on ecosystems and human well-being (Pecl et al. 2017) and evaluating critical habitat for species at risk (Leston et al. 2023), linking biodiversity and ecosystems function (Antunes et al. 2024), among many others.\nMultiple studies have identified climate refugia (Michalak et al. 2018) under multiple climatic scenarios (Stralberg et al. 2018, AdaptWEST) for various taxonomic groups in North America (Stralberg et al. 2017). Conservation strategies (Belote et al. 2017, Ranius et al. 2023) to inform conservation planning (Carroll et al. 2017, Stralberg et al. 2020, Stralberg et al. 2020, Droboski et al. 2021) and the implications for costs and configuration of protecting areas (Lawler et al. 2020) under climate change scenarios have been also evaluated.  \n\nStralberg et al. (2020) developed a conservation ranking map for North America to identify priority areas, including climatic macro-refugia for trees and birds (e.g., Stralberg et al. 2018), microrefugia (using environmental heterogeneity surrogates, that is topography, e.g., Ackerly et al. 2010) and climatic corridors (Carroll et al. 2018, Anderson et al. 2023). Buenafe et al. (2023) applied a climate-smart conservation planning framework that prioritizes the protection of climate refugia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy Models (OMs)\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy Models (OMs) are used to account for imperfect detection of organisms in surveys and to determine the probability of the true presence or absence of a species at a site. \"They do so by modeling the probability that a species occupying a site is detected, often including environmental covariates to explain variation in detectability among sites (MacKenzie et al., 2002)\" (Stewart et al. 2022). They can be used to model single  (Gould et al. 2019) and multi-species occupancy ( Devarajan et al. 2020). And, OMs have shown some potential of conservation prioritization (e.g., Calderón et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies Trait Models (STMs)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints\" (Kearney & Porter 2009).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical models of local biodiversity change\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Linear mixed effect models are used to explain variation in a measure of diversity, such as species richness, or biodiversity intactness across sites varying in human land use (Newbold et al. 2015). Multiple studies have applied this approach using site species composition data obtained from the Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems (PREDICTS) database. This work repeatedly finds average declines in local diversity, relative abundance and functional group diversity due to human pressures (land use intensity, human density) on land cover (Newbold et al. 2015, 2016). Similar approach was applied to assess the impact of human pressures on genetic diversity (Millette et al. 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dissimilarity Models (GDMs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox BF.1.1: Examples of weaving multiple knowledge systems in biodiversity research, conservation, management: Species\nYarchuk (2023) wove multiple knowledge systems to explore the best practices for working across cultures in good ways with the ultimate goal of improving moose research and monitoring. A case study with Magnetawan First Nation (MFN), a small Anishinabek community along the eastern coast of Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada. Some of the results are:\n- Co-creating ethical space within research and monitoring, including some key values that multiple partners shared in the region (respect, listening, clear expectations and equality, among others).\n- Three main themes arose to consider when fostering Ethical Space:\n- “an emphasis on the process through which partners come together,\n- the importance of partnerships being founded on personal relationships, and \n- the ability for the process and relationships to evolve over time” (Yarchuk 2023).\n- Weaving Knowledge Systems through Community-based .\nDrake et al (2023) identified “key decision points (i.e., points in a research or monitoring project where significant decisions are made that contribute to bridging) that shape projects co-implemented by researchers and Inuit communities”. Three major decision points that shape collaborative research or monitoring between researchers and Indigenous Peoples were identified:\nLamb et al. 2022 showed how the  West Moberly First Nations and Saulteau First Nations (in BC Canada) came together to avert the extirpation of Klinse-Za mountain caribou and plan caribou recovery on the lands they have long stewarded and shared.\nprotect species. “In collaboration with many groups and governments, this Indigenous-led conservation initiative paired short-term population recovery actions, predator reduction and maternal penning, with long-term habitat protection in an effort to create a self-sustaining caribou population” (Lamb et al. 2022).\nSimilarly, Goolmeer & van Leeuwen (2023) showed how empowering Indigenous-led actions under the collaborative management of culturally significant species is key to species persistence of an iconic species in Australia.\nThe Weaving Ways of Knowing for the Environment initiative in Canada presents multiple case studies of environmental research and monitoring programs that weave Traditional Knowledge and Western Science. Case studies, they say, are “...are proof that a theory can be taken and put into practice, and can provide concrete examples of what weaving knowledge systems entails and how it can be successful. They also offer inspiration into approaches or methodologies that can be used to gather desired information, or the types of questions that can be answered”. Some of the past and on-going case studies are:\n- Impacts of Railways on Species at Risk\n- Community-led Wildlife Monitoring With Trail Cameras\n- Imalirijiit, a Community-based Water Monitoring Program\n- Grizzly Bear Monitoring according to Heiltsuk Law\n- Exploring Biocultural Diversity Through Art\n- Monitoring Polar Bears in the Eeyou Marine Region (James Bay, Canada) with Cameras and   Hair Samples Monitoring James Bay Polar\n- Operationalizing knowledge coevolution: towards a sustainable fishery for Nunavummiut\nJohnson et al. (2023) reviewed studies “that claims to weave Indigenous and Western ways of knowing in ecotoxicology and wildlife health in Canada, coding for background information, wildlife health stressors, research methods, Indigenous participation, and research outcomes”. “This exploration led to the conclusion that research that weaves ways of knowing must not be approached with a”one-size-fits-all” mindset, but instead should emphasize relationship building, continuous engagement, and ethical practices. By adopting such practices, Western-trained, non-Indigenous academics can better address critical wildlife health concerns while contributing meaningfully to advancing healing and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples” (Johnson et al. 2023) .\nECOSYSTEM MODELS\nGlobal Vegetation Models\nThese are equilibrium process-based models that simulate the potential distribution of generalised types of natural vegetation on the basis of the physiological properties of plant groups, average seasonal climate and hydrological conditions and the direct physiological effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (i.e., increased water-use efficiency by plants). Like Global Climate Models, GVMs are used to understand how climate change will drive changes in the distribution of major plant taxa (e.g., boreal, temperate and tropical forests, grasslands, shrubland, tundra).\nLeemieux & Scott (2005) used two GVMs models, BIOME3 (Haxeltine & Prentice 1996) and Mapped Atmosphere Plant Soil System (MAPSS) (Neilson 1995) to project the future equilibrium outcome of vegetation across Canada’s protected area network at the time. They found over 40 percent of Canada’s protected areas are projected to experience a change in biome type as a result of climate change, the results of this study contribute to a growing body of research that questions the capacity of existing protected area networks to fulfil this objective in an era of global climate change.\nLand cover and land use changes models\nAn array of spatially explicit models has been developed to simulate and predict the possible future outcomes of land cover and land use changes. For instance, the CLUE model is a dynamic, spatially explicit, land cover and land use change model used in multiple applications such as deforestation, land degradation, urbanization, land abandonment and integrated assessment of land cover change and urban growth (Zhou et al. 2016), among others. For the conversion of land use and its effects at a small region extent the CLUE-S model has been developed (Gao et al. 2021). The Dyna CLUE integrates demand-driven changes in land area with locally determined conversion processes (Verburg & Overmars, 2009). \nCellular Automata Markov simulation models have been also used to quantitatively simulate and predict land use change  (Kang et al. 2019, Beroho et al. 2023, Leta et al. 2021,Kang et al. 2019, Lu et al. 2019, Debnath et al. 2023, Zhang & Li 2013).\nMore sophisticated models like Future Land Use Simulation model (FLUS, Li et al. 2017,; Zhang et al. 2020) simulate multiple land use scenarios; and the  GMOP-PLUS model which analyzes changes in ecological and economic benefits and carbon emissions by optimizing the quantitative structure and spatial layout of land use in different scenarios (Meng et al. 2023).\nCombining models and their strengths are also usual, for instance Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) is a top-down approach that can solve problems with conflict objectives, however it is not spatially explicit, so it has to be coupled with other models such as, for instance the Dynamic Conversion of Land Use and its Effect (Dyna, Wang et al. 2018).\nMethods to downscaling global land use have also been developed (West et al. 2014, Yourek et al. 2023) to fit in Integrative Assessment Models (IAMs, Pereira et al. 2010, Harfoot et al. 2013).\nHarmonized sets of past and present land cover and land use methods are needed to simulate future scenarios (Hurt et al. 2006, Hurt et al. 2011). Assessing uncertainties in LCLUC projections  (Prestele et al. 2016) is also fundamental for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem change.\nSome models (CLIMATESAVE Integrated Assessment Platform, GLOBIO) are used to evaluate multiple drivers of change (LCLUC and CC) that might affect biodiversity and ecosystem services (Veerkamp et al. 2020).\nEnd-to-end ecosystem models (E2E)\nThese models include multiple biophysical, social and economic components and the full cycle of processes to predict changes in the state of ecosystems in response to multiple drivers and management scenarios (e.g., Cuddington et al. 2013). Rose et al. 2012 describe E2E as follow “(1) aims to represent the entire food web (including multiple species or functional groups at each of the key trophic levels as well as top predators in the system) and the associated abiotic environment; (2) requires the integration of physical and biological processes at different scales; (3) implements two-way interaction between ecosystem components; and (4) accounts for the dynamic forcing effect of climate and human impacts at multiple trophic levels.” Some examples include ATLANTIS (for marine ecosystems,Audzijonyte et al. 2019) and for coastal regions (Mutsert et al. 2021).\nProcess-based models\n“Process-based models, which explicitly parameterize peatland hydrological, thermal, and biogeochemical processes, can account for the complex interactions among factors that are important in driving the dynamics of peatland ecosystems (e.g., temperature, soil moisture, vegetation type, thaw depth, CO2 fertilization). They are useful tools to explore responses of peatlands to future climate changes” (Qiu et al. 2022, e.g., 3-PG: Adaptation of Asia Pacific forest to climate change). They were developed to address some research gaps of carbon balance models.  Qiu et al. (2022) highlighted three gaps:\n\nStandardized the use of similar critical inputs to draw robust conclusions from simulations.\nInclude the contribution of different greenhouse gasses (GHGs such as CO2 and methane) to understand the influence of peatlands on global carbon cycle and climate change.\nUse a large time scale to understand the peatland response to warming.\n\nSome of the state-of the-art large-scale process-based peatland models are:\n\nORCHIDEE-PEAT (Qiu et al. 2018, Qiu et al. 2019)\nLPJ-MPI (Kleinen et al. 2012)\nLPX-Bern (Waina et al. 2009)\nLPJ-GUESS (McGuire et al. 2012)\nLPJGUESS_dynP (Chaudhary et al. 2017).\n\nBox BF.1.2: Examples of weaving multiple knowledge systems in biodiversity research, conservation, management: Ecosystems\n“Given the large proportion of intact peatlands in North America, conservation is particularly important. A good example from Canada can be seen in the IPCAs, where Indigenous governments have the primary role of protecting and conserving ecosystems through Indigenous laws, governance and knowledge systems” (UN Global Peatland Assessment 2022).\nSze et al. (2022) assessed whether deforestation and degradation are reduced on Indigenous Lands (ILs) and their effectiveness relative to Protected Areas (PAs) across the tropics. They found that:\n- “Deforestation is reduced in ILs relative to non-protected areas across the tropics, avoiding deforestation comparably to PAs and Protected Indigenous Areas (PIAs) except in Africa, where they avoid more.\n- Similarly, degradation is reduced in ILs relative to non-protected areas, broadly performing comparably to PAs and PIAs” (Sze et al. 2022). \nThese findings suggest that Indigenous communities and their customary practices do help forest conservation. \nAlejo et al. (2022) investigated the effect of community managed protected areas on  protecting aboveground carbon stocks, using “carbon density maps, matching methods, geographic discontinuity designs, and sensitivity analysis between 2003 and 2015”. They found that “Community Managed PAs were more effective than Other Lands (i.e., unprotected) and Sustainable Use PAs, and at least as effective as Strict PAs, in preserving carbon stocks and avoiding emissions”. \nSilvano et al. (2022) showed how  Fishers’ Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK)  “can provide unique information on a range of topics that are beyond the reach of most conventional scientific studies, enabling assessments of long-term changes to resources, fisheries, and the environment”. They compiled a set of 56 selected case studies from fishers’ knowledge worldwide highlighting the main contributions of ILK to fisheries, conservation, and ecology of aquatic ecosystems (see Figure)\n“Some of the main research areas and contributions to fisheries, conservation, and ecology of aquatic ecosystems arising from the sample of 156 selected case studies from fishers’ knowledge” (Figure source Silvano et al. 2022)."

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are statistical, correlating spatial distribution (occurrence or abundance data across locations) with environmental and geographic variables (spatial environmental data) describing those locations (see Elith & Leathwick 2009, for a review). SDMs use spatial environmental data to make inferences about species’ range limits and habitat suitability; conceptually they are mapping components of the species’ ecological niche through space and time. These models now hold a prominent place within biodiversity science because computing facilities now allow easy use of spatial data layers (GIS software) and remote sensing products that describe geographic environmental structure can be combined with large data sets of species occupancy (e.g. obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility).\nAn SDM model can be used to predict the species’ distribution across a large geographic extent under different scenarios of environmental (e.g., climate) change. They are widely used in conservation assessments comparing species distributions under different scenarios both in target-seeking and exploratory scenarios (see Scenarios section).\nSDMs have been implemented for multiple purposes including assessing prioritization scenarios to protect biodiversity (Berteaux et al. 2018, Eckert et al. 2023), linking local to regional conservation (Albert et al. 2017, DeLuca et al. 2023), biological invasions (Lezner et al. 2019), impacts on ecosystems and human well-being (Pecl et al. 2017) and evaluating critical habitat for species at risk (Leston et al. 2023), linking biodiversity and ecosystems function (Antunes et al. 2024), among many others.\nMultiple studies have identified climate refugia (Michalak et al. 2018) under multiple climatic scenarios (Stralberg et al. 2018, AdaptWEST) for various taxonomic groups in North America (Stralberg et al. 2017). Conservation strategies (Belote et al. 2017, Ranius et al. 2023) to inform conservation planning (Carroll et al. 2017, Stralberg et al. 2020, Stralberg et al. 2020, Droboski et al. 2021) and the implications for costs and configuration of protecting areas (Lawler et al. 2020) under climate change scenarios have been also evaluated.  \n\nStralberg et al. (2020) developed a conservation ranking map for North America to identify priority areas, including climatic macro-refugia for trees and birds (e.g., Stralberg et al. 2018), microrefugia (using environmental heterogeneity surrogates, that is topography, e.g., Ackerly et al. 2010) and climatic corridors (Carroll et al. 2018, Anderson et al. 2023). Buenafe et al. (2023) applied a climate-smart conservation planning framework that prioritizes the protection of climate refugia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy Models (OMs)\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy Models (OMs) are used to account for imperfect detection of organisms in surveys and to determine the probability of the true presence or absence of a species at a site. “They do so by modeling the probability that a species occupying a site is detected, often including environmental covariates to explain variation in detectability among sites (MacKenzie et al., 2002)” (Stewart et al. 2022). They can be used to model single  (Gould et al. 2019) and multi-species occupancy ( Devarajan et al. 2020). And, OMs have shown some potential of conservation prioritization (e.g., Calderón et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies Trait Models (STMs)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints” (Kearney & Porter 2009).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical models of local biodiversity change\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Linear mixed effect models are used to explain variation in a measure of diversity, such as species richness, or biodiversity intactness across sites varying in human land use (Newbold et al. 2015). Multiple studies have applied this approach using site species composition data obtained from the Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems (PREDICTS) database. This work repeatedly finds average declines in local diversity, relative abundance and functional group diversity due to human pressures (land use intensity, human density) on land cover (Newbold et al. 2015, 2016). Similar approach was applied to assess the impact of human pressures on genetic diversity (Millette et al. 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dissimilarity Models (GDMs)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis class of models analyze and predict spatial patterns of turnover in community composition (beta diversity) across large regions (Ferrier et al. 2007). They have been used for multiple purposes from identifying the potential impact of climate change on composition across Australia (Ferrier et al. 2012) to evaluating future scenarios of LCLUC and Climate Change (Di Marco et al. 2019), identifying high-value biodiversity habitat (Mokany et al. 2020), creating biodiversity surrogates for conservation assessment (Ware et al. 2018), and biodiversity analysis and conservation (Mokany et al. 2022), among many others. Additional approaches to assess patterns and drivers of beta diversity at different spatial scales have been proposed (see He et al. 2023). General dissimilarity models go beyond single species and predict community-level features such as community composition and species turnover or richness (Ferrier & Guisan 2006).\nAssessment of Status\n\n\n\nScope\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nSpecies distribution\nSpecies Distribution Models (SDMs)\nSDMs - Maxent\nGerstner et al. (2024)\nGalante et al. (2022)\nArce et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Vegetation Models\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are equilibrium process-based models that simulate the potential distribution of generalised types of natural vegetation on the basis of the physiological properties of plant groups, average seasonal climate and hydrological conditions and the direct physiological effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (i.e., increased water-use efficiency by plants). Like Global Climate Models, GVMs are used to understand how climate change will drive changes in the distribution of major plant taxa (e.g., boreal, temperate and tropical forests, grasslands, shrubland, tundra).\n\nLeemieux & Scott (2005) used two GVMs models, BIOME3 (Haxeltine & Prentice 1996) and Mapped Atmosphere Plant Soil System (MAPSS) (Neilson 1995) to project the future equilibrium outcome of vegetation across Canada’s protected area network at the time. They found over 40 percent of Canada’s protected areas are projected to experience a change in biome type as a result of climate change, the results of this study contribute to a growing body of research that questions the capacity of existing protected area networks to fulfil this objective in an era of global climate change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand cover and land use changes models\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of spatially explicit models has been developed to simulate and predict the possible future outcomes of land cover and land use changes. For instance, the CLUE model is a dynamic, spatially explicit, land cover and land use change model used in multiple applications such as deforestation, land degradation, urbanization, land abandonment and integrated assessment of land cover change and urban growth (Zhou et al. 2016), among others. For the conversion of land use and its effects at a small region extent the CLUE-S model has been developed (Gao et al. 2021). The Dyna CLUE integrates demand-driven changes in land area with locally determined conversion processes (Verburg & Overmars, 2009). \nCellular Automata Markov simulation models have been also used to quantitatively simulate and predict land use change  (Kang et al. 2019, Beroho et al. 2023, Leta et al. 2021,Kang et al. 2019, Lu et al. 2019, Debnath et al. 2023, Zhang & Li 2013).\nMore sophisticated models like Future Land Use Simulation model (FLUS, Li et al. 2017,; Zhang et al. 2020) simulate multiple land use scenarios; and the  GMOP-PLUS model which analyzes changes in ecological and economic benefits and carbon emissions by optimizing the quantitative structure and spatial layout of land use in different scenarios (Meng et al. 2023).\nCombining models and their strengths are also usual, for instance Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) is a top-down approach that can solve problems with conflict objectives, however it is not spatially explicit, so it has to be coupled with other models such as, for instance the Dynamic Conversion of Land Use and its Effect (Dyna, Wang et al. 2018).\nMethods to downscaling global land use have also been developed (West et al. 2014, Yourek et al. 2023) to fit in Integrative Assessment Models (IAMs, Pereira et al. 2010, Harfoot et al. 2013).\nHarmonized sets of past and present land cover and land use methods are needed to simulate future scenarios (Hurt et al. 2006, Hurt et al. 2011). Assessing uncertainties in LCLUC projections  (Prestele et al. 2016) is also fundamental for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem change.\n\nSome models (CLIMATESAVE Integrated Assessment Platform, GLOBIO) are used to evaluate multiple drivers of change (LCLUC and CC) that might affect biodiversity and ecosystem services (Veerkamp et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-to-end ecosystem models (E2E)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese models include multiple biophysical, social and economic components and the full cycle of processes to predict changes in the state of ecosystems in response to multiple drivers and management scenarios (e.g., Cuddington et al. 2013). Rose et al. 2012 describe E2E as follow “(1) aims to represent the entire food web (including multiple species or functional groups at each of the key trophic levels as well as top predators in the system) and the associated abiotic environment; (2) requires the integration of physical and biological processes at different scales; (3) implements two-way interaction between ecosystem components; and (4) accounts for the dynamic forcing effect of climate and human impacts at multiple trophic levels.” Some examples include ATLANTIS (for marine ecosystems,Audzijonyte et al. 2019) and for coastal regions (Mutsert et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess-based models\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Process-based models, which explicitly parameterize peatland hydrological, thermal, and biogeochemical processes, can account for the complex interactions among factors that are important in driving the dynamics of peatland ecosystems (e.g., temperature, soil moisture, vegetation type, thaw depth, CO2 fertilization). They are useful tools to explore responses of peatlands to future climate changes\" (Qiu et al. 2022, e.g., 3-PG: Adaptation of Asia Pacific forest to climate change).

    "text": "2. Biodiversity Observation Networks (BON)\nA BON is a network of observation sites or stations and a network of groups who produce and use biodiversity data across these sites for different needs. A BON coordinates observations and monitoring to support policy and environmental legislation prompting conservation action from national biodiversity strategies and action plans. A BON is designed to overcome the major challenges associated with monitoring the changing state of biodiversity with the temporal and spatial resolution and scope required to supply the information and knowledge to support policy action.\nGuidelines for network establishment are publicly available by GEO BON (Navarro et al. 2017). They describe how to create an ‘enabling environment’ that assembles the partnerships, human capacity and scientific infrastructure needed to build a BON. A BON can be national, subnational or regional in its level of operation and can cover different biomes (for example, marine or freshwater) and dimensions of biodiversity (such as genetics, species and ecosystems) to fill specific knowledge gaps. These needs have been recognized by the formation of marine, freshwater, soil and omic BONs. \nNational BONs can act as national units and networks bringing biodiversity change data and information together. Sub-national BONs are strategic initiatives that can address specific needs and realities of multiple partners and respond to particular ecological conditions within the country (e.g., Kühl et al. 2020). Some multinational networks exist that represent collaborations among national BONs. These include the Asia Pacific BON, the European network (EuropaBON), and the Arctic BON.\nThe Parks Canada initiative in the Hudson-James Bay region may wish to deploy a BON to support the gathering of data and knowledge by both western and indigenous science. \n\n2.1. What does an operational BON do\nA BON starts with the formation of an actor-partnership network, this involves partnerships between organizations that gather and curate biodiversity knowledge with those that use data and braid traditional knowledge and western scientific systems to understand where and why biodiversity is changing. Collaboration among these groups establishes an observation network that produces and braids biodiversity knowledge in a holistic understanding of environmental change. Traditional Knowledge is formed by continued interaction and observation of species and ecosystems and is transferred over many generations. As an organisation, a BON is therefore particularly suited to assessing short and long-term environmental changes and their consequences for people.  \nOver the last 15 years GEOBON has provided a series of recommendations for realizing a monitoring system that recognizes the value of different knowledge sources and types to track progress, understand change and guide action (Navarro et al. 2017, Gonzalez et al. 2023). The framework includes multiple steps, and we present the key elements of each step. \nThe framework applies locally to biodiversity and ecosystem services, helping to understand how they are changing. For example, the framework can be used to guide data collection efforts on fish populations to produce indicators relevant to fisheries that support the management of populations and allow Canada to report on the state of its wild fish populations.\nThe activities of the BON structured, depicted below, according to several modules interconnected by flows of data and information that produce new knowledge about the changing state of biodiversity.\n\n\n\nA BON is composed of modules interconnected by flows of data and insights that produce new understanding by bridging and braiding diverse knowledge sources and systems about the changing state of biodiversity. The activities within the modules are conducted by (1) distributed network of actors, organizations, and agencies coordinating observations and (2) gathering data and observations into curated repositories, (3) for their analysis and synthesis to assess and explain trends and attribute meaning to the trends for people and wildlife; (4) this understanding is used to support forecasts of change under expected conditions, and scenarios that assess change under a range of alternative policy scenarios and futures (5).\n\n\n\nData and knowledgeMonitoringPlanningReporting\n\n\n\nData collection, curation and sharing of existing knowledge on biodiversity: Existing knowledge on biodiversity change is mobilized and shared, while additional data is collected and continually shared, building a deep knowledge, and understanding of biodiversity and its processes.\nOrganizations can utilize existing sources of biodiversity knowledge developed by governments, non-government agencies, research institutes, indigenous peoples and local communities, and civil societies. For example, community-based monitoring and information systems (CBMIS) focused on local level efforts and complemented by systematic data collection on species population and ecosystem monitoring schemes (Moussy et al. 2021) can be coordinated to produce a rich understanding of biodiversity change. Local traditional or Indigenous knowledge can not only add to observations, but guide the monitoring itself, for example by helping to determine the relevant spatial and ecological units that are to be observed, and to set targets that are also meaningful locally. The agreed-upon set of observations can be translated into metrics and indicators where needed to harmonize observations across schemes, which supports the accumulation and sharing of biodiversity data and knowledge across systems and space. he development of national and sub-national BONs can be supported by the use of BON in a Box, a platform that combines tools for the entire process of designing, planning, monitoring and evaluating the state and trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services.\nBottom-up and top-down approaches for data collection should be linked. This ensures that locally and nationally collected data support the estimation and use of indicators relevant to supporting decisions in the region (Burgass et al. 2021, Eicken et al. 2021, Nicholson et al. 2021). A bottom-up and top-down approach promotes the data from field-based observations made by different groups (e.g., professional biologists, local indigenous communities and citizens) using a range of technologies for in-situ data acquisition and sharing, with data from a top-down approach involving Earth observation and remote sensing (e.g. space agencies satellites derived products, Ferrier 2011, Kühl et al. 2020, Skidmore et al. 2021). This two-way flow of information on the state biodiversity is necessary to support decisions at local, regional, national, and global scales. GEO BON and its partners are developing all components of this knowledge system, including interoperable tools to facilitate national-scale monitoring and indicator reporting systems.\n\n\n\nFrom left to right - the flow of data, information and knowledge from observation to assessments and reporting of change via indicators used to track progress and guide action. The framework captures how evidence from observations made in-situ, or remotely, feeds into the essential variables framework to infer change over time. These observations can be generated using traditional knowledge or Western technology to produce data that is used to estimate essential variables. These essential variables in turn form the basis for calculating indicators used to track progress, and guide action in line with regional or national strategic action plans. These indicators may derive from traditional knowledge systems and from western science methodologies. At the national level, these indicators can be used to report progress towards the goals and targets of the Global Biodiversity Framework. At the local level, these indicators can support planning and action, the effects of which will in turn be seen through the indicators. This process is continuous with monitoring efforts ongoingly adapted to meet the needs of management efforts and improve trend detection.\n\n\nFor such an integrated system to be effective, gaps in the taxonomic and geographic coverage of data should continue to be filled through prioritized data collection. Standardized data sets in public databases should be utilized (e.g. Ocean Biodiversity Information System, OBIS1; Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF) and shared following FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable - (Wilkinson et al. 2016) and CARE - collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility and ethics - (Carroll et al. 2020) principles.\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring science: Common standards and protocols for best practices in monitoring and modelling are followed and links established between scientists and non-professional data collectors to improve the flow of information from data to indicator and policy through well-coordinatedinvestment in monitoring and ongoing data collection. \nRegional and national BONs can harmonize the collection of data and tacit knowledge on biodiversity trends and drivers. BONs, as partnerships of data providers and users, support the coordination and harmonization of data collection across biodiversity and other environmental observation systems (e.g. for climate, or other physical variables) for large regions. For interoperability, much of the collected biodiversity data is processed into essential variables (e.g. essential biodiversity variables, EBVs; essential ecosystem services EESVs; essential ocean variables, EOVs, and essential climate variables, ECVs) and used to produce indicators, employing common, but flexible indicator methodologies that are applied at multiple (national to local) scales (delivered via common, but customizable tools and toolkits).\nBiodiversity information should be integrated for scale-appropriate use. Fine scale and local data sets can inform local policy and may be aggregated for regional assessments. Global monitoring data sets may be disaggregated (top-down) where relevant to inform local and nationally relevant actions and fill gaps.\n\n\n\n\nPlanning and prioritization: Knowledge is used to produce indicators that enableattribution of observed biodiversity change to drivers (direct and indirect). This informs strategic planning ofactions to manage biodiversity, prioritise actions and adapt monitoring programs to improve data collection and understanding of biodiversity change.) \nThree complementary considerations required the use of indicators with effective monitoring. The first is to track overall progress made towards targets through designed monitoring schemes that cover relevant geographic gradients and events over time while balancing logistical constraints (e.g. human resources and technologies). The second is to progressively improve knowledge of how drivers cause biodiversity change, thereby allowing observed changes in trends to be attributed to changes in drivers and actions. The third approach uses leading indicators to inform strategic planning (including prioritization) of actions to achieve targets and goals effectively and efficiently (Stevenson et al. 2021). This includes forecasting of biodiversity and ecological function and scenario planning to evaluate possible outcomes of management actions. For this, we use leading indicators (currently not included in the GBF monitoring framework) which use best-available understanding of these dependencies – at the time a given decision is made – to predict the expected impact of the proposed or implemented actions on biodiversity outcomes.\nAll three of these approaches are important and play complementary roles in an overall adaptive policy and planning framework guided by biodiversity monitoring. Indicators to comprehensively cover outcomes, drivers and key interdependencies between them are essential to set priorities and guide action. BONs enable the production of the observations needed to support indicator use over time. Depending on these results, additional or different monitoring efforts may be called for and adaptive monitoring frameworks. BONs the flexibility to respond to these needs.\n\n\n\n\nReporting progress: The indicators estimated from monitoring data support the production of national reports that describe progress made towards achieving the targets and goals of the GBF. \nThe outcome of actions and adaptive monitoring efforts contribute to the global effort to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services. Understanding national and global progress towards the GBF follows a defined protocol set out by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and relies on its monitoring framework. The indicators agreed for inclusion in the monitoring framework of the GBF are included in the national biodiversity strategy and action plans (NBSAPs) and national reports (recommendationSBSTTA 24/2), and in other planning and policy instruments at national and subnational levels. Actions can be adjusted according to trends in predictive (leading) indicators. Compliance and accountability mechanisms, including the use of component, complementary and other national indicators, are in place to review the implementation of NBSAPs and their relevance to GBF goals and targets (Xu et al. 2021).\nNational monitoring is mainstreamed within national statistical systems for environmental accounts (i.e., UN SEEA) and across key sectors that impact biodiversity (e.g., agriculture, mining, etc.). Financial support and opportunities should be in place, and can be updated, to support and incentivize the implementation of the GBF and monitoring framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of weaving multiple knowledge systems: Translating stakeholder narratives into models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVukamanovic et al. (2023) addressed “the practice of translating narratives into models and using those narratives to interpret and communicate results.  Involving stakeholders’ perspectives through narratives in participatory modeling fosters better understanding of the problem and evaluation of the acceptability of tradeoffs and creates buy-in for management actions. However, stakeholder-driven inputs often take the form of complex qualitative descriptions, rather than model-ready numerical or categorical inputs”. They offer eight starting points lessons to translate narrative into models:\n- Understand what stakeholders want from the process\n- Find the right team for the job\n- Define boundary conditions as a team\n- Find the right tool(s)\n- Evaluate model trade-off with stakeholders\n- Use an iterative process to adapt, refine and pivot\n- Focus on the process as much as the outcome\n- Use a synthesis narrative to bring together multiple perspectives\n\n\n\nIntegrating an iterative stakeholder process and and iterative environmental model development. Figure from Vukamanovic et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n2.2. Monitoring with Essential Variables (EVs)\nEssential variables are standardized variables critical for detecting changes in the structure and dynamics of a facet of Earth’s system (e.g., climate, ocean, biodiversity). All essential variables represent a minimum collection of data or measurements that capture a specific dimension of the phenomena of interest and are critical for detecting change across space and time. \nEssential variables are therefore located at the interface between data (primary observations), indicators (synthetic or derived metrics), and user-specific societal or policy goals (e.g., Sustainable Development Goals, Balvanera et al.2022, see also Kim et al. 2023). Integrating in-situ observations, remote sensing (e.g., Saranya et al. 2024, Skidmore et al. 2021), modelling, and other tools is fundamental to support the production of essential variables and their use in monitoring (Fernández et al. 2020).\n\n\n\nEssential Biodiversity Variables as defined by GEOBON; there are six EBV classes with 21 EBV candidates, focused on genetic composition, species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem function, and ecosystem structure. The UN CBD has endorsed the EBV framework as means to support monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services and for reporting progress under the monitoring framework of the GBF (UN CBD, 2022).\n\n\nOver the last decade, GEOBON has developed two main groups of essential variables to support monitoring, and modeling of biodiversity and ecosystem services change: Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs; Pereira et al. 2013) and Essential Ecosystem Services Variables (EESVs; Balvanera et al. 2022).\n\nEssential Biodiversity VariablesEssential Ecosystem Services Variables\n\n\n\nThe UN CBD has endorsed the EBV framework as means to support monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services and for reporting progress under the monitoring framework of the GBF (UN CBD, 2022). EBVs are biological state variables that capture different dimensions of biodiversity change within a speciﬁed range of spatial and temporal grain and extent (Schmeller et al. 2017, Bellingham et al. 2020). There are six EBV classes—genetic composition, species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem structure—that group twenty-one EBVs.  \nEBVs are also scalable, meaning the underlying observations can be used to represent required for the analysis of trends at different spatial or temporal resolutions. For example, ecological community data collected at a location from different sampling events or methods can be combined into a single multivariate analysis for the analysis of dissimilarity or turnover in community composition (Ferrier et al. 2007). The aggregated data may indicate the change in ecological communities across the region resulting from land use change or climate change.\n\nThe process of operationalizing EBVs is shown in the Figure below. The EBV data “cube” has dimensions of space, time and EBV. The cube is filled by biodiversity observations made by people, depositing raw observations into databases using standard formats and metadata (e.g. Humboldt extension to the Darwin core; Guralnick et al. 2017), and processing the data. The information in the EBV cube helps to detect and model biodiversity change for science and policy (lower box). The underlying drivers and pressures of biodiversity change can then be identified (Gonzalez et al. 2023) and modelled (Oliver et al. 2015). Validation of modelling can then feed into global and regional policy processes to explain observations, to improve forecasting of biodiversity change, and to support regional and global assessment reports.\n\n\n\nThe workflow with the EBVs data cube population with data obtained from data repositories or observations from BONs made in situ or from remotely. The data cube can be analyzed along dimensions of space and time and modeled to obtain estimates of change, attribution of causes for the change, and forecasts to guide decisions and support policy assessments (adapted from Schmeller et al. 2017).\n\n\nA subset of EBVs can be monitored from space to support the analysis of geospatial patterns over large spatial extents (Skidmore et al. 2021). A comprehensive list of remote sensing biodiversity products is available that can support the monitoring of biodiversity patterns via Earth observation. The ecosystem structure and ecosystem function EBV classes, which can also capture the ecological effects of disturbance, as well as habitat structure, were shown by an expert review process to be the most relevant, feasible, accurate and mature classes for direct monitoring of biodiversity via satellites. Other EBVs, including movement (Jetz et al. 2022) and community composition are increasingly monitored by remote sensing (Cavender-Bares et al. 2022). Open access to workflows translating remote sensing products into EBVs will accelerate the reporting of the state of biodiversity from local to global scales.\n\n\n\nRanking and scoring approach for the identification and use of some remote sensing products. This methodology can be applied to identify variables for the HJBL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction to ensure the long-term sustainability of ecosystems and livelihoods of people living in the HBJL will require systematic monitoring of ecosystem services (ES) (IPBES 2019). However, ecosystem service studies typically rely on one-off assessments and often lack methodological standardization, hindering comparisons across space and time. To ensure strong evidence to support trend detection, many policy initiatives now require systematic information on ES change (e.g., Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services – IPBES, System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Ecosystem Accounting – SEEA-EA, UN CBD GBF). This context requires ES monitoring to be standardized, policy-relevant, economically feasible, and interoperable across contexts, levels, and services.\nTo standardize the monitoring of ecosystem services, GEO BON proposed the Essential Ecosystem Service Variables framework (EESVs; Balvanera et al. 2022). EESVs track interactions between people and nature in social-ecological systems, particularly how nature contributes to human well-being through ES. \nThe EESV framework was designed to holistically streamline and standardize the collection of data on ecosystem services. It proposes to focus on six classes of data to collect for any ecosystem service of interest. The six EESV classes are: Ecological Supply, Use, Demand, Anthropogenic Contribution, Instrumental Value, and Relational Value. \n\nEcological Supply is the ecosystem structure and functions that influence an ecosystem’s potential to deliver ESs. \nUse is the actualized appropriation of an ES by humans. \nDemand is the implicit or explicit desire or need for an ES. \nAnthropogenic Contribution is the investments humans make to increase Ecological Supply or Use, often through the process of co-production. \nInstrumental Value is the benefit(s) obtained from an ES. \nRelational Value is the importance ascribed by people to positive relationships between humans and nature and among humans via nature. Relational Value represents a step towards plural valuation, which seeks to include values held by diverse groups and their unique worldviews (Jacobs et al. 2020, IPBES 2022, Pascual et al. 2023, Flood et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the classes of Essential Ecosystem Services Variables. All six classes are highlighted in a distinct color and exemplified with icons relevant to a fishery as an example of an ecosystem service. The abundance of fish is a measure of ecological supply. The catch is a measure of use. The consumption of fish by people is a measure of demand. The cultural significance of the fishery is a measure of relational value. The monetary value of fish sales is a measure of instrumental value. The size of the fishing fleet is a measure of anthropogenic contribution. Monitoring these variables together makes understanding the changing state of an ecosystem service possible.\n\n\nThe partnership represented by a BON should determine the choice of EESVs to monitor, types of decisions to support, and who will be involved in monitoring the ES. In a recent study, Schwantes et al. (In press) proposed that monitoring EESVs be organized in four steps: (1) define EESVs and acquire primary data, (2) transform data into EESVs, (3) analyze and interpret trends in EESVs for decision-making, and (4) use EESVs to assess the impact of policy or management interventions. \nSchwantes et al. (In press) applied the EESV framework to three ecosystem services in British Columbia including salmon fisheries, orca whale watching, and freshwater regulation; they point out the challenges associated with gathering the different types of social, economic, and ecological data needed to fit models that allow assessments of change and reasons for trends in the focal ecosystem service.\n\n\n\nEssential ecosystem service variables proposed steps are estimated from primary observations that are collected locally by different rights holders (e.g. Indigenous Peoples, government, NGOs) and used to produce indicators that can inform decision making or be used in local planning and/or national reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of weaving multiple knowledge systems: Assigning value to cultural ecosystem services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlood et al. (2021) showed the importance of peatlands in Ireland for local communities by assigning value to cultural ecosystem services. Two major questions should also motivate HJBL partners to assign value to cultural ecosystem services in the HJBL:\n- How can a more expansive range of current and historic peatland values be represented to better account for local knowledge, experiences, and cultural contexts?\n- How can these emerging cultural values be made more visible to harness societal shifts in how peatlands are used, viewed, and valued to foster more sustainable future trajectories?”\nThey finally suggest three recommendations for integrating temporal and local dimensions to valuing cultural ecosystem services: remembering, reimaging and restoring.\n\n\n\nIntegrating temporal and local dimensions to valuing cultural ecosystem services. Normyle et al. (2022) added Indigenous perspectives of care, and more generally of ecosystem state as a holistically perceived and culturally defined attribute, to an ecosystem accounting framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n2.3. Monitoring workflows: linking observation and EBV to indicators\nGEO BON’s framework for monitoring biodiversity change involves the production of EBVs/EESVs and indicators from observations about the state of biodiversity. The Figure below shows a typical workflow where data from different primary sources of observations (e.g. in situ, remote sensing, field observations by local communities) are combined with biodiversity models to produce layers of spatial and temporal variation in ecosystem extent and species distribution EBVs. \nIn some cases, one EBV can be an input to a model to produce another EBV (see chapter 5 below). This information is then integrated and summarised within geographic or governance reporting units ((1) and (2) in the figure) to calculate an indicator of biodiversity change, which can then be used, for instance, for reporting progress towards an GBF target. Note that this indicator can be processed within any spatial unit (e.g. a watershed, an ecoregion, to a country, or an entire biome). \nEBVs and models can also be used to project changes in the indicator using scenarios (see chapter 6 below). Although both raw observations and indicators might change in the future, including with the development of new observation techniques and the expression of new user needs, the EBVs should, by definition, remain the same.\n\n\n\nThe data-to-indicator workflow that places EBVs at the centre. Observations are combined to produce EBV data layers that can be used with models to calculate biodiversity change indicators and assess future change using alternative scenarios (Source: Navarro et al. 2017)."

Arctic Observatories\nThe Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON)\nThe Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON) facilitates, coordinates, and advocates for coordinated international pan-Arctic observations and mobilizes the support needed to sustain them. The SAON “was initiated in 2011 to address the persistent shortcomings in the coordination of Arctic observations that are maintained by its many national and organizational partners. SAON set forth a bold vision in its 2018 strategic plan to develop a roadmap for Arctic observing and data systems (ROADS) to specifically address a key gap in coordination efforts—the current lack of a systematic planning mechanism to develop and link observing and data system requirements and implementation strategies in  the  Arctic  region” (Starkweather et al. 2021).\n SAON has included three main objectives in its Strategy 2018-2028:\n\nCreate a roadmap to a well-integrated Arctic Observing System; \nPromote free and ethically open access to all Arctic observational data; and, \nEnsure sustainability of Arctic observing. \n\nThe Shared Arctic Variable Framework main objective is to link local to global observing systems, by “identifying benefits to Indigenous communities, supporting fundamental understanding of Arctic systems and regional decision-making needs,  and  informing  science  and  decision-making  needs  at  the  global  scale and integrating with operational global networks” (Starkweather et al. 2021). Shared Arctic Variables (SAVs) are unique because they recognize 1) the  role  of  Indigenous  Peoples  of  the  Arctic; 2) include multiple sectors and biophysical components; 3) limited resources means being strategic;and,  4) an unique environment  (Bradley et al. 2022). HJBL is an opportunity to articulate global and regional initiatives along with community based monitoring that we describe below.\nCanadian Consortium for Arctic Interoperability\nThe Canadian Consortium for Arctic Data Interoperability (CCADI) is an initiative to develop an integrated Canadian arctic data management system that will facilitate information discovery, establish sharing standards, enable interoperability among existing data infrastructures, and that will be co-designed with, and accessible to, a broad user base. Key to the CCADI vision are: standards and mechanisms for metadata, data and semantic interoperability; a distributed data exchange platform; streamlined data services with common entry, access, search, match, analysis, visualization and output tools; an intellectual property and sensitive data service; and data stewardship capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Sharing and Interoperability Concepts and Architecture: Canadian Consortium for Arctic Data Interoperability for contributions to a CanBON\n\n\n\n\n\nA key intent of the GEO BON - Parks Canada - ECCC workshop held in Montreal, October 2023, was information gathering on data resources, technical capacities, and technological knowledge, systems, and methodologies to mobilize biodiversity and conservation knowledge to action. This workshop focused on investigations of the components for the formation of a potential ‘CanBON’, a Canadian Biodiversity Observation Network (BON), based on the conceptual framework provided by the GEO (Group on Earth Observations) flagship BON work programme. Working closely with the Cree communities in the Hudson and James Bay Lowlands, and the Mushkegowuk Council that represents them collectively, for example, a CanBON knowledge mobilization system would necessarily accommodate different knowledge systems, approaches to conservation and land stewardship, and cultural and data sensitivities.\nThis document describes the technical framework and distributed, interoperable architectural approach of the Canadian Consortium for Arctic Data Interoperability (CCADI) as one potential contribution to a CanBON. The CCADI framework developed from collaborations beginning in 2015 among Canadian Arctic data centres having a common goal of providing ethically open, accessible, and comprehensive digital resources to the broadest possible audience of data users. The initiative was developed to integrate the Canadian arctic data management system to establish sharing standards, enable interoperability among existing data infrastructures and diverse data streams, co-designed with, and accessible to, a broad user base. In 2018, CCADI received funding from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) to develop an Arctic Research Data Infrastructure (ARDI). The ARDI is an evolving integrated Canadian Arctic data management system that facilitates information discovery, establishes sharing standards, enables interoperability among existing data infrastructures, and that is co-designed with, and accessible to, a broad user base. The base components remain in use today. Key to the CCADI vision and its base components include: standards and mechanisms for metadata, data, and semantic interoperability; a distributed data exchange platform; streamlined data services with common entry, access, search, match, analysis, visualization and output tools; an intellectual property and sensitive data service; and data stewardship capacity.\nThe CCADI technical framework builds on more than two decades of collaborative work in the arctic research data management community focused on harnessing the power of data and information technologies to support knowledge construction, information decision making and improving lives and livelihoods. This framework includes more than the software and technical systems, but also the diverse data streams, information products, language and worldviews, and social networks—all of which exist and evolve in a socio-technical ecosystem. The socio-technical ecosystem is a foundational concept in CCADI, and is described in greater detail in the bullet point below. \nBased on a retrospective of GCRC’s experiences from the engagement in several international and national scale projects, this document briefly outlines a model of the technical and non-technical dimensions that have been central to achieving goals set out by diverse “communities” such as those represented in the CCADI consortium. We recognize the challenges in operationalizing western research for actionable, grounded outcomes, the limited social and technical connections that foster this action, and the uncertainties introduced by the rapidly changing broader data and information ecosystem (e.g., generative AI, cybersecurity threats). Thus, the CCADI framework is presented in the spirit of enhancing options that leverage opportunities and address challenges in the Canadian context broadly. This framework is also able to integrate new opportunities that are emerging such as increased recognition of Indigenous knowledge, data, and world views, generative AI and machine learning, semantic modeling, and new interdisciplinary data sources (such as community-based monitoring applications built on custom, open source, or proprietary software).\nKey components of a CCADI model include:\n- Socio-Technical Systems: A foundational concept in the CCADI initiative is seeing the overall system as a socio-technical system that includes various kinds of technology (that is not confined to information technology), technical processes, and social processes. Socio-technical refers to the interrelatedness of social and technical aspects of an organization or systems as a whole. A CCADI information ecology analytical tool package adopted a visual mapping approach to draw out the links between language, the natural environment, social and cultural practices, heritage, and customary practices and rituals, as appropriate to share with those outside of the community, and to meet the shared goals of the data ecosystem.\n- Collaborative Approach: Integrating a wide range of actors in a data ecosystem through the CCADI framework necessarily takes a collaborative approach. The co-development mechanisms are reflexive, iterative, and adaptable to change if the desire to share and participate changes. The CCADI architecture includes a metadata and semantics mediator to enable interoperability over the spectrum of standards and variances in terminology or conceptualizations to share across different sciences or knowledge systems.\n- Standards and Web Protocols: A CCADI-like system architecture would be based on international standards specifications (for data, metadata, and internet exchange protocols) such as those published by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Based on free and open-source software (FOSS) components, a modular or transportable framework that can be deployed many times, and hosted anywhere. This translates to technical and administrative practicality for partner collaborations to launch their own independent partner node in the system in a distributed approach. In this approach, partner nodes can, together, act as distributed nodal networks that use Application Programming Interface (API) exchange protocols to connect and become accessible.\n- Principles: The diversity of partners in the CCADI system, all having potentially widely different data and information access, control, and sharing constraints and concerns requires guiding principles to enable these spheres to interact in a cohesive system that meets project goals and works to the benefit of all partners. CCADI architecture is built on a number of principles to include: FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable); IASC Statement of Principles and Practices for Arctic Data Management, which serves to bridging between Traditional Knowledge, Indigenous Knowledge, and “Western” scientific knowledge such that they are seen as equal and complementary; The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK) National Inuit Strategy on Research (NISR); CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics; and, The First Nations principles of ownership, control, access, and possession – more commonly known as OCAP.\n\n\n\nBack to top"

    "text": "4. Implementing a BON as Knowledge Hub\nIn practice, GEO BON suggests a stepwise, iterative approach to establishing and implementing BONs, drawing upon existing processes, standards, and tools and offering a multi-knowledge platform or hub . Implementing a knowledge hub involves four development phases: engagement, assessment, design, and implementation. This flexible approach has been used and adapted for the Arctic, Australia’s New South Wales, Colombia, Finland and most recently for EuropaBON.\nThe assessment phase of the BON development aims to capitalize on existing data and knowledge infrastructures. For instance, the French BON identified over 130 in situ observation infrastructures, mostly observing EBVs within the species traits, species populations, and genetic composition classes. Similarly, a Finnish assessment of the national indicators and the biodiversity monitoring programs underlying them showed that aside from species populations and ecosystem structure, most EBV classes are still poorly covered by the Finnish monitoring system. The same observation was made for the Colombia BON which identified over 100 different tools for biodiversity observation, data management and reporting. These assessments thus help governments and organizations to prioritize and strategically fill key gaps in their existing or developing observation systems.\n\n\n\nFramework and development process of Biodiversity Observation Networks (BONs).

    "text": "5. BON-in-a-Box\nCore to the establishment of a harmonized monitoring system is the need for the scientific community to share data, knowledge, and tools. The accessibility, interoperability, and reporting of biodiversity data and indicator workflows (e.g. code-based scripts for running models) is paramount. To support this effort, GEO BON has launched BON-in-a-Box to support organizations with their need to make knowledge guiding data and monitoring information available to all.\nGEO BON’s large community of members contributes to the development of EBVs and the models used to explain biodiversity change and calculate indicators designed to inform policy action. BON-in-a-Box is an open-source platform designed to i) support the use of indicators by parties to the CBD, ii) supporting local communities with the use of their data to calculate indicators, and iii) working with businesses and financial institutions to guide capital flows to mitigate biodiversity change restore ecosystems.\nBON-in-a-Box interlinks the available data, models, and computing and data science in a knowledge service making it available to all . It accelerates the development of predictive workflows and EBV-based indicator products that support biodiversity change detection and attribution across BONs varying geographic extents. BON-in-a-Box is ready to be applied to the HJBL.\n\n\n\nBON-in-a-Box is an information infrastructure designed to support national and regional monitoring and indicator calculation and reporting. Across four modules it provides access to data and scientific code to estimate EBV and EESVs and gathers indicator workflows for open use. It also guides the optimal location of monitoring sites to reduce data gaps and improve detection and attribution of biodiversity change across a BON.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeaving multiple knowledge systems into observatories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity-based monitoring and information systems (CBMIS) refer to initiatives by indigenous peoples and local community organisations to monitor their community’s well-being and the state of their territories and natural resources, applying a mix of traditional knowledge and innovative tools and approaches (Ferreira et al. 2015).\nCariño & Ferrari (2023) suggested some transitions based on the Forest People Programme, Local Biodiversity Outlook 2 (FPP 2020) to mainstream and prioritize support for the rights and collective actions of Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLC) throughout the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.\n- Land transitions: “The territories of life of IPLC, including their distinct cultural, spiritual and customary relationships with their lands and waters and their intrinsic and vital contributions to human wellbeing, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation and adaptation, are secured. The collective lands, territories and resources of IPLC are legally recognized and protected in keeping with international law; land-use classifications and land registration to uphold customary tenure are reformed; and the global coverage of areas conserved, sustainably used and restored are progressively and significantly increased” (FPP 2020). \n- Economic transitions: “Diverse and human-scale economic systems are thriving, within which IPLC customary sustainable use and other small-scale producers are contributing to sustainable and resilient economies and scaled-down consumption patterns are guaranteeing a sustainable and just society” (FPP 2020).\n- Food transitions: “Vibrant ecosystems and cultures ensure genetic diversity and diverse diets, improving health, resilience and livelihoods. Revitalized Indigenous and local food systems contribute to local food security, food sovereignty and agroecology, and underpin a just agricultural transition” (FPP 2020). \n- Governance: “Vibrant ecosystems and cultures ensure genetic diversity and diverse diets, improving health, resilience and livelihoods. Revitalized Indigenous and local food systems contribute to local food security, food sovereignty and agroecology, and underpin a just agricultural transition”(FPP 2020). \n- Incentives and financial transitions: “Incentives, including financial support for IPLC collective actions and innovative culture-based solutions, are prioritized; environmental, social, and human rights safeguards on biodiversity financing are applied; and perverse incentives and harmful investments are ended or redirected” (FPP 2020).\n\n\n\n\nBack to top"

    "text": "3. Topics to consider when applying models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-scale analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\nProcesses and patterns of ecological systems operate and vary as a function of spatial (extent and resolution) and temporal scale (e.g.,Hewitt et al 2017) and it is expected that the response to multiple anthropogenic drivers also vary in space and time (Bastazini et al. 2021).\nMany biodiversity and ecosystem function models operate at different spatial and temporal scales, which poses a challenge for integration (Isbell et al. 2017).” (Weiskopf et al. 2022).\nNew sources of data sets, vast amount of data (e.g., remote sensing and citizen science) and the need to evaluate and respond to local and regional realities have accelerated the development of these multiscale spatial and temporal analyses.\n\n\nRe-evaluating global assessments using local datasets\nFor instance, Dinerstein et al. (2020), identified global areas providing co-benefits by protecting biodiversity and carbon stocks aimed to secure global climate stability (Global Safety Net, GSN). However, Finkelstein et al. (2023) applied the same approach in Ontario (Canada), using local data sets, and found that “when region-specific data are incorporated, Ontario is even more significant than what is shown in the GSN, especially in terms of carbon stocks in forested and open peatlands.”  Zhu et al. (2021) went further and addressed the issue of spatial scales in Asia, arguing that a “framework should be capable of identifying priorities at each scale (regional, biome, and national)”. They proposed “a stepwise approach based on scalable priorities at regional, biome, and national levels that can complement potential Convention on Biological Diversity targets of protecting 30% land in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.” \nIntegrating multiple knowledge systems\nFire regimes characterization using remote sensing (Hanes et al. 2018, Coops et al. 2018) have been used to inform management activities for government agencies (Erni et al. 2019) and along with Indigenous land stewardship have provided tools to advance proactive fire mitigation (Copes et al. 2022).\nDeveloping multi-scale scenarios\nRosa et al. (2017) have proposed a two-step strategy to develop a new generation of scenarios within the IPBES (2016) framework, as follows: ?” (i) extend existing global scenarios developed by the climate-science community, by modelling impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services (Fig. 1a); and (ii) make an ambitious effort to create a set of multiscale scenarios of desirable ‘nature futures’, based on the perspectives of different stakeholders, taking into account goals for both human development and nature stewardship (Fig. 1b).” (See figure here).\nLinking the influence and dependence of people on biodiversity across scales\nIsbell et al. (2017)\n\n\nMultiscale dependance has been documented widely:\n\nBiophysical processes, identify patterns in nature (e.g., Brian & Catford 2023, Mod et al. 2020, Meng et al. 2023, Wand & Loreau 2014, Spake et al. 2020, Leroy et al. 2023).\nBiodiversity patterns (Hulbert & Jetz 2007, Chase et al. 2018, Jarzyna & Jetz 2018).\nInform decision making to secure the provision of ecosystem services (Andersonn et al. 2015, Lindborg et al. 2017, Liu et al. 2017, Raudsepp-Hearne & Peterson 2016, Le Provost et al. 2023).\nProtection of biodiversity (Ekroos et al 2016, Hurlbert & Jetz 2007, Slabbert et al. 2020, Mayor et al. 2015).\nManagement (Ladouceur et al. 2023).\nInvasive alien species (Kotowska et al. 2022).\nEcosystem services (Qin et al. 2023, Liu et al. 2017, Hein et al. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating top-down and bottom-up approaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are these?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\nTop-down approaches are driven by policy mandates and/or directives, requiring changes in socioeconomic systems (e.g., SDGs and CBDs goals and targets) and designed to force behavioral change through policy.\nHowever, there is also growing interest to develop and implement bottom-up approaches (e.g., Wallner et al. 1996), that is those approaches that influence policy through collective behavior (individual actions that can propel massive impact when adopted by communities) and/or motivate research to answer questions at local scales.\n\n\nCoupling socio-ecological interactions at local levels with large scale planning strategies\nSee Ding et al. (2023)\nCodesign, comanagement, and coproduction\n“..the implementation of principles of codesign, comanagement, and coproduction is facilitated greatly by focusing on pressing societal problems at a scale that intersects interests of both local communities in a particular region and large-scale observing efforts” (Eicken et al. 2021 ).\n\n\nTop-down approaches are usually the first approximation in model implementation, scenario assessment (e.g., Moss et al. 2010, Meinshause et al. 2020,  and Popp et al. 2017), and tools’ development (e.g., Map of Life, InVEST, GLOBIO-ES).\nFor bottom-up approahces, GLOBIOM is “used to  analyze the competition for land use between agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy, which are the main land-based production sectors. The model is built following a bottom-up setting based on detailed grid-cell information, providing the biophysical and technical cost information”.\nThere is growing interest in evaluating top-down approaches with local and regional data sets (Siabi et al. 2023), economic sectors (Calheiros et al. 2023), and integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches (Ding et al. 2022, Eicken et al. 2021) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Intercomparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\nModel intercomparisons bring together different communities of practice for comparable and complementary modeling, in order to improve the comprehensiveness of the subject modeled, and to estimate uncertainties associated with scenarios and models (Frieler et al., 2015).\n\n\nIntercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (BES-SIM)\n“The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land-use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e., nature’s contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models” (Kim et al. 2018) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating multiple systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounting for the dependence of ecosystem services on biodiversity\nIntegrated Assessment Models (IAMs)\nModel integration seems to offer a pathway to understand complex systems and inform decision making. However, current models are global, make multiple assumptions and can generate high spatial and temporal uncertainty. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have been developed to respond to this need of integration. Originally, IAMs were developed to evaluate multiple scenarios of climate change, mainly focused on economic sectors (e.g., energy) aimed to inform alternative policies in GHG emissions reduction.  Recently, they have been extended to other sectors and customized to include land cover and land use change, some biodiversity facets and ecosystem services. However, their implementation is limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoupling models and tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome analyses require coupling several models to accomplish their objectives. For instance,\n\nprojecting land cover and land use change (LCLUC) to assess ecosystem services under multiple scenarios requires coupling Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) to  optimized solutions for each land use type subject to a series of constraints specified by a given scenario  and the Dynamic Conversion of Land Use and its Effects (Dyna-CLUE) to allocate the predicted land use changes to grid cells following a bottom-up process (Wang et al. 2018).\nLi et al. (2023) have used the “Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) to assess the features of land utilization conversion and forecasted land utilization under three development patterns in 2030” and then the “InVEST model to estimate changes in carbon storage trends under three development scenarios in 2000, 2010, 2020, and 2030 and the impact of socioeconomic and natural factors on carbon storage”. \n\nThere are also strategies to ensemble models to reduce uncertainty. For instance, Hooftman et al. (2022) and Willcock et al (2023) evaluated the effect of ensemble models to reduce certainty gaps in spatially explicit ecosystem services. (e.g,  using multiple ecosystem accounting platforms such as InVEST, ARIES, and Co$tingNature).\n\nStralberg et al. (2015) used multiple GCMs projections and SDMs to evaluate signal vs. noise in the response of bird abundance to climate change. They found that for 58% of 80 boreal songbird species over the next 30 years—increasing to 88% of species by the end of the century—the climate change “signal” in projections of abundance was greater than the “noise” generated by uncertainty due to a combination of sampling error, variable selection, and choice of global climate model (GCM)” (Stralberg et al. 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA non-exhaustive list of models & Tools!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do:\n\nReview this for additional models: EcoService Models Library (ESML)\n\n\n\n\nBack to top"

    "text": "2. Multi-objective approaches\nMulti-objective approaches are designed to maximize co-benefits and minimize trade-offs among objectives in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services management (Kass et al. 2024).\nPreliminary studies have identified areas of importance for both biodiversity conservation and multiple ecosystem services (see Robertson et al. 2017; Mitchell et al. 2021); others have integrated ecosystem services within spatial biodiversity conservation prioritization (Ramel et al. 2020), and others have used multi-objective optimization methods to design marine protected area networks (Fox et al. 2019) or used natural vegetation retention as a proxy to achieve multiple targets (e.g., biodiversity, carbon storage, freshwater quality and soil maintenance;  Simmonds et al. 2022) agricultural allocation (Kaim et al 2018) and penalizing infeasible solutions (Strauch et al. 2019).\nThis approach focused mainly on the identification of priority areas for a facet of biodiversity and one or more ecosystem services. It is been implemented at global scales; however recent efforts at regional and national scales make this approach useful for biodiversity and ecosystem services planning. Scenario assessment in this approach is rare (not that many publication in this direction); however, it is becoming to be considered in this approach (see next section).\n\n\n\nMulti-objective approach\n\n\nThere is an opportunity to apply these approaches to the HJBL, in a way that weaves multiple knowledge systems into scenarios adapted to the possible biophysical and biocultural futures of the region.\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) calls for actions to integrate biodiversity conservation and climate change strategies, as follows:\n“There is ample evidence that climate change affects biodiversity. Continued climate change is having predominantly adverse and often irreversible impacts on many ecosystems and their services, with significant negative social, cultural and economic consequences. However, the links between biodiversity and climate change flow both ways. Conserving natural terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems and restoring degraded ecosystems (e.g., Obeng et al. 2022), including their genetic and species diversity, is essential for the overall goals of both the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change because ecosystems play a key role in the global carbon cycle and in adapting to climate change, while also providing a wide range of ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation, which integrates the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services into an overall adaptation strategy, can be cost-effective and generate social, economic and cultural co-benefits and contribute to the conservation of biodiversity.” (CBD).\nLet’s see some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity and global climate stability (carbon storage)\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple approaches for identifying priority areas for biodiversity and carbon storage have been implemented. It starts from overlapping maps of biodiversity metrics and carbon storage or using prioritization tools to more complex assessments using ecosystem services tools and integrating multiple models aimed to identify common areas for these two components. The rationale here is that protecting carbon-rich areas that provide a global climate stability service, will protect biodiversity (and other physical processes) in the region that in turn can buffer ecosystem functioning against the effects of multiple drivers of change. Here, we summarized some studies evaluating biodiversity and carbon storage co-benefits under the IPBES (2016) conceptual framework.\n\nOverlapping mapsES Assessment Tools\n\n\nCo-benefits of biodiversity and carbon storage have been recently explored by Soto-Navarro et al. (2020), Dinerstein et al. (2020), Finkelstein et al. (2023) and Zhu et al. (2021). They basically overlap maps of carbon-rich areas and biodiversity maps derived from some metrics to identify those areas that might offer co-benefits (see Case study below) to achieve 30% of protected areas by 2030. Zhu et al. (2021) went a little further and used the Zonation tool to identify priority areas across scales (i.e., Asia, India, and ecological regions). The Figure below shows these exploratory studies within the IPBES (2016) conceptual framework (they used limited elements from the full set of potential models and tools available in the Toolbox).\n\n\n\nMulti-objective approach used by Soto-Navarro et al. (2020), Dinerstein et al. (2020), Finkelstein et al. (2023) and Zhu et al. (2021) to identified areas offering co-benefits between biodiversity and carbon storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverlap maps of carbon-rich and biodiversity-important areas maps\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere\nGlobal, Asia, Ontario (Canada)\nAim\nMultiple studies identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation planning in carbon-rich areas.\nDescription\nSoto-Navarro et al. (2020) evaluated the global spatial overlap of biodiversity and carbon, using five biodiversity metrics summarized in two composite biodiversity indicators that incorporate a vulnerability component (see Brooks et al. 2006) and multiple measurements of carbon (belowground, aboveground and soils organic content).  \nDinerstein et al. (2020), uses 11 spatial layers to identify global terrestrial areas to protect biodiversity and provide climate stabilization by securing terrestrial carbon stocks. They called this approach the Global Safety Net (GSN), using the Global for Nature framework as “a time-bound, science-based plan to be paired with the Paris Climate Agreement to save the diversity and abundance of life on Earth” (Dinerstein et al. 2019).\nFinkelstein et al. (2023) applied the same approach in Ontario (Canada) and found that “when region-specific data are incorporated, Ontario is even more significant than what is shown in the GSN, especially in terms of carbon stocks in forested and open peatlands.”\nZhu et al. (2021), addressed this issue of spatial scales in Asia, arguing that a “framework should be capable of identifying priorities at each scale (regional, biome, and national)”. They proposed “a stepwise approach based on scalable priorities at regional, biome, and national levels that can complement potential Convention on Biological Diversity targets of protecting 30% land in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.” \nGoals/targets (biodiversity conservation/human well-being):\n2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals\nPost-2020 global biodiversity framework, CBD\nUnited Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nLimitations:\nBiodiversity metrics vary in each approach, and they might not include all facets of biodiversity\nThese studies do not consider the full IPBES (2016) framework.\nStrengths:\nMulti-objective, multi-scale, and spatially explicit approaches\nActions taken or suggested:\n- “Funding mechanisms are needed to ensure such targets to support biodiversity-carbon mutually beneficial solutions” (Zhu et al. 2021).\n- “There is an urgent need to identify synergies for biodiversity conservation and carbon as a basis for action” (Zhu et al. 2021).\nImpacts/results (potential and/or measured):\n\n\n\nReference\nFindings/potential impact\n\n\nSoto-Navarro et al. (2020)\n“There is 38 and 5% overlap in carbon and biodiversity hotspots, for proactive and reactive conservation, respectively”.\n“Only around 12 and 21% of these proactive and reactive hotspot areas, respectively, are formally protected.”\n\n\nDinerstein et al. (2020)\n“…35.3% of land area is needed to conserve additional sites of particular importance for biodiversity and stabilize the climate.”\n\n\nZhu et al. (2021)\n41% of priorities overlap between all three scales.\n\n\nMori et al. (2021)\nExplicit focus on global forest biodiversity-carbon feedbacks under climate change. Mitigating climate change protects forest diversity which in turn maintains productivity and carbon in the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nOverlapping maps have been used also in India to prioritize areas for habitats, biodiversity, ecosystem services to “guide future environmental planning and policy to help meet the twin goals of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in a strategically important country for Asia” (Srivathsa et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-objective and gap analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nOther approaches are proposed by Martin et al. (2022) and Johnson et al. (2022), using multi-objective optimization and gap analysis. For instance, Martin et al. (2022) showed that using a multi-objective optimization approach to simultaneously protect important areas for caribou (see Canadian Geographic maps, Arctic Caribou), other species at risk, climate refugia and carbon storage in  the boreal forest across Canada, produced a reasonably strong outcome compared with single objectives.They used a multi-objective linear programming problem to simultaneously address all six conservation objectives, formulated as a “maximin” problem. This maximin problem seeks to identify the set of planning units that maximize the minimum summed conservation value of priority areas for the set of conservation objectives, when selecting at most 19.5% of the boreal caribou distribution for protection” (Martin et al. (2022).\n\nA gap analysis allows for the identification of elements that are poorly represented in a conservation network by comparing the network’s current state to an expected or desired state. Johnson et al. (2022) used a gap analysis “to evaluate the overlap among hotspot types and how well hotspots were represented in Canada’s protected and conserved areas network”. They “identified hotspots of high conservation value within the distribution of boreal caribou based on: (1) three measures of biodiversity for at risk species (species richness, unique species and taxonomic diversity); (2) climate refugia or areas forecasted to remain unchanged under climate change; and, (3) areas of high soil carbon that could add to Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions if released into the atmosphere” Johnson et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\nIn general, all these studies show that:\n\nOverlapping areas of high and low value is a good exploratory approach to see what are the main priority areas in a region. One advantage is that this approach can be implemented with available methods and data sets might be available for the region.\nThe location and importance of priority areas might be influenced by the specific biodiversity metrics included in the analysis.\nThere is low to moderate overlap between priority areas for biodiversity and carbon storage. It depends on the biodiversity metric used (e.g., species richness vs. areas of high intactness) and it varies among ecoregions.\nProactive and reactive conservation approaches should be evaluated because they can identify different priority areas.\nAdditional priority areas might emerge when performing analysis across spatial scales (e.g., from ecoregion to regional and national).\nUsing prioritization tools instead of just overlapping maps might improve the identification of priority areas.\nAdding local data sets to the analysis can improve the identification of priority areas and their relative spatial value.\nThese studies present a snapshot in time of priority areas for biodiversity and carbon storage (further analysis should consider temporal scales).\nMulti-objective linear program seems to provide a more accurate approach to identify priority areas based on multiple conservation objectives.\nMulti-objective outcomes seem to be better than single outcomes.\nAnalyses show that priority areas from multi-objective outcomes are underrepresented in current analyses of protected area networks, highlighting  opportunities to extend these co-benefits to the entire network.\nScenario assessment is not considered in these approaches.\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem services tools such as InVEST™, ARIES and Co$tingNature are available to identify nature’s contribution to people, assess synergies (co benefits among ESs) and quantify trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services (in particular for carbon storage-soil pools). These tools can integrate complex interactions and beneficiaries (Thierry et al. 2021) under various scenarios (e.g., climate change, land cover change, urban growth, management interventions, etc; see for instance: Brown et al. 2015).\nThese tools offer an interface and functionality to run some analyses using custom models and spatially-explicit maps as inputs to generate spatially-explicit outputs. For instance, Land cover and land use map (LCLU) along with stocks in carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter) is an input for the carbon storage module.  \nFor instance, Mulligan et al. (2020) (see Case study below) used Co$tingNature to examine nature’s contributions to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6s: drinking water, sanitation and hygiene and functioning of water-related ecosystems) in Madagascar and the Volta basin in Burkina Faso.\nAlso, multiple scenarios, derived from land use and climate change models, can be modeled in these tools. However, some additional models are necessary to forecast land use change and climate change. For instance, Li et al. (2023) (see Case study below) used  InVEST tool and Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model (to create inputs for the inputs for the ES tools) to evaluate the effect of multiple scenarios on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Tao et al. (2023) integrated the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model and integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs (InVEST) model to simulate and assess future LCLU and ecosystem carbon storage in the Nanjing metropolitan circle in 2030 under four scenarios. They showed that collaborative development can balance economic development and ecological protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARIES\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\nIndia\nMexico\nSouth Africa\nAims:\nNatural Capital Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services\nDescription:\nThe UN project  “Natural Capital Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services” (NCAVES) launched in 2017 has initiated pilot testing SEEA Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) in five participating partner countries, namely Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa (see NCAVES for countries’ findings). NCAVES is “funded by the European Union via a Partnership Instrument and has been jointly implemented by the United Nations Statistics Division and  the United Nations Environment Programme, in collaboration with the Convention on Biological Diversity(CBD)”.\nIn this analysis we are interested in findings related to determining the spatial distribution of carbon stored in different pools and their annual value per year.\nGoals/targets (biodiversity conservation/human well-being):\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)\nNational indicators\nLimitations:\n- Estimations of multiple carbon pools come from different sources which in turn might have different methods to calculate carbon metrics.\n- Land cover maps also have different sources (tailored for each country).\n- India: reported using two platforms: ARIES and InVEST (there is no explicit comparison between outputs from these two platforms).\n- Mexico and South Africa: it is not clear if they use ARIES (and InVEST).\n- China does not include carbon storage in its report but it is the only one that includes scenario analysis for other ecosystem services (in particular the effect of climate change on land cover extent).\n- South Africa: maps of carbon storage are not presented and calculations are presented by biomes (it is not clear that multiple carbon pools were considered).\n- Difficult to compare the value (units) of carbon stored between countries and different spatial aggregation methods among countries.\nStrengths:\n- They present estimates of multiple ecosystem services accounts and SDGs indicators for multiple estates.\n- Carbon storage is aggregated and presented using different administrative boundaries: ecoregions, land cover classes.\nActions taken or suggested:\n- They argue that they can inform Sustainable Development Goals by using ecosystems accounts SEEA framework and tools (ARIES) for calculating SDGs targets’ indicators. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo$tingNature\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\nMadagascar and Volta Basin (spanning six countries in Africa) (Mulligan et al. 2020)\nAim: Examine nature’s contribution to SDG 6s (drinking water, sanitation and hygiene as well as functioning of water-related ecosystems), co-benefits with other SGDs (biodiversity and carbon storage) and trade-offs (agriculture).\nDescription:\n“We use remotely- sensed and globally available datasets alongside the spatial ecosystem services assessment tools, WaterWorld and Co$tingNature (see www.policysupport.org). With these we identify priority areas for sustainable management to realise SDG 6 (water) at the country scale for Madagascar and the basin scale for the transboundary Volta river basin. The spatial mapping of SDG provision by nature has the potential to support the implementation of SDG strategies through prioritising areas for sustainable land management and conservation of ecosystem services and also to inform the further development of the SDG concept itself as well as for their intrinsic value.” (Mulligan et al. 2020).\nGoals/targets (biodiversity conservation/human well-being):\nTarget 6.1: “By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all”.\nTarget 6.2: “By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations”.\nTarget 6.6: “By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes”.\nLimitations:\nBiodiversity is reduced to one metric (endemism)\nSome key challenges identified by the study (Mulligan et al. 2020):\n- “Significant differences in magnitude and spatial pattern between different datasets available for the same variable”.\n- “Lack of detailed validation of some global EO products for all contexts, which creates challenges in understanding which metrics are the most robust or accurate for a given variable in specific geographical contexts”.\n- “Less than global extent even of so-called global product”.\n- “Differences in production year and thus snapshot time for different variables or different datasets for the same variable”.\n- “Differences in grid cell resolution that must be resolved for raster analysis”. \n- “Lack of seasonality or treatment of temporal variability”.\n- “The need to ensure consistency between different input layers”\n- “Time lag between image acquisition and generation of available global EO products” .\n- “Data sometimes have an associated license cost or restrictive licensing”.\nStrengths:\nSpatially explicit Nature’s Contribution to SDGs, co-benefits and trade-offs\nMedium spatial resolution appropriate for national scale studies\nActions taken or suggested:\n“In general our results highlight the co-benefits of sustainably managing nature’s contribution to SDG 6, for protecting forest cover (SDG target 15.2) and thus carbon storage and sequestration as a contribution to the Paris climate agreement and nationally determined contributions (SDG 13) as well as biodiversity conservation (SDG target 15.5)”.(Mulligan et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\nIn general these studies show that:\nEcosystem Assessment Tools offer a sophisticated functionality to perform exploratory analyses using data sets already available within these tools. However, the trade off is a simplification of the processes they model. For example, carbon models are simple representations of carbon storage dynamics matching land cover classes with carbon pools. \nThese tools can provide spatial-explicit assessment of Nature’s contribution to people (e.g., evaluating the contribution to SDGs) and trade-offs among ecosystem services.\nUsually models included in these tools (InVEST, ARIES, and Co$tingNature , and others) are coupled with other models to generate inputs for the tool. For instance, Liu et al. 2023 combines the strengths of three models (GMOP-PLUS-InVEST) to enhance the quantitative prediction and spatial prioritization output when evaluating the alteration of ecosystem services under multiple scenarios, as follow:\n\nSimulation of quantitative Land-Cover and Land-Use (LCLU) demand in 2035 under different scenarios, using the gray multi-objective programming model (GMOP model, Wang et al. 2018).\nThen, the amount of future LCLU is allocated to a reasonable location according to spatial needs using the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS model, it is based on cellular automata see Liang et al. 2021). \nFinally, a module (e.g., Water Yield) of the InVEST model can be used to evaluate the alterations in water yield under different scenarios.\n\nSimilarly, Zhuet al. (2022) have coupled GMOP and PLUS models to simulate ecosystem service value and Gao et al. (2023) coupled System Dynamics models (SDs), GMOP and InVEST to inform ecosystem services accounting and decision making in China. Kramer et al. (2023) also showed the importance of connecting existing models to advance in freshwater modeling and scenario developing.\nAn alternative way to reduce uncertainty in the predictions of individual models is to create model ensembles of ecosystem services. Reducing the “uncertainty gap”  Willcock et al. 2019) in model predictions is needed to better inform decision making (Hooftman et al. 2022) and achieve national and global targets. “Ensembles of models are hypothesised to have enhanced accuracy over individual models due to fewer overall errors in prediction by reducing the influence of idiosyncratic outcomes from single models” (Hooftman et al. 2022). For instance, Willcock et al. (2019) shows that ensembles of multiple models of ecosystem services at global scales were 2 to 14% more accurate than individual models.  Similar results were found by Hooftman et al. 2022 at national scales (5 to 17% higher accuracy for ensemble models compared to individual ones). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon storage, biodiversity and water\n\n\n\n\n\nMulticriteria models are used to prioritize the selection of sites for conservation. For example, Jung et al. (2021) ranked terrestrial conservation priorities globally with a joint optimization that minimized the number of threatened species, maximized carbon retention and water quality regulation. They found that “selecting the top-ranked 30% and 50% of terrestrial land area would conserve respectively 60.7% and 85.3% of the estimated total carbon stock and 66% and 89.8% of all clean water, in addition to meeting conservation targets for 57.9% and 79% of all species considered” (Jung et al. 2021). Similarly, Martin et al. (2022) used linear programming (Beyer et al. 2016) to rank sites for dual protection (i.e., Caribou and carbon storage). Conlisk et al. (2023) also show potential benefits of wetland conservation in North America, including: water supply regulation, flood risk mitigation, water quality, biodiversity support, carbon storage, among others.More about water provision or a separate heading?\nFor water balance the WaterWorld model is available (Mulligan 2013 included in the Co$tingNature tool), able to produce hydrological baselines and can be used to apply multiple scenarios of climate change and evaluate policy options for management interventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change refugia and biodiversity in carbon-rich areas\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure and function of ecosystems and associated biota are expected to change and turnover in the coming decades. Some species will shift their spatial distributions, others will adapt in response to novel climates, while others will suffer extinction (e.g., Gillings et al. 2014, Chen et al. 2011). Climate change refugia–“areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and socio-cultural resources (Morelli et al. 2016)–will offer opportunities for species to survive and act as”slow lanes” for dispersal rather than areas of stasis (Morelli et al. 2020).\nMultiple studies have identified climate refugia (Michalak et al. 2018) under multiple climatic scenarios (Stralberg et al. 2018, AdaptWEST) for various taxonomic groups in North America (Stralberg et al. 2017). Conservation strategies (Belote et al. 2017, Ranius et al. 2023) to inform conservation planning (Carroll et al. 2017, Stralberg et al. 2020, Stralberg et al. 2020, Droboski et al. 2021) and the implications for configurating protected area networks (Lawler et al. 2020) under climate change scenarios (Buenafe et al. 2023). Protected areas networks should include how climate will change in the future and vary across regions to effectively protect biodiversity, in particular for those species that might shift their ranges to cooler climates (Carroll & Ray 2021). \nMethods to identify climate refugia include:\n\nSpecies Distribution Models, using many species.\nClimate velocity metrics (forward and backward velocities)\nGeneration refugia index, using various approaches\nCompositional-turnover modelling (Reside et al. 2013, ADAPTNRM)\n\nStralberg et al. (2020) developed a zonation conservation ranking map for North America designed to identify priority areas, including climatic macro-refugia for trees and birds (e.g., Stralberg et al. 2018), microrefugia (using environmental heterogeneity surrogates, that is topography, e.g., Ackerly et al. 2010) and climate corridors (Carroll et al. 2018, Anderson et al. 2023). Although, “commonalities between ecosystem carbon and either current biodiversity or refugia are often weak” , these overlapping areas are worth protecting (Carroll and Ray 2021). \nThe HJBL and its peatlands (characterized by high surface soil moisture and water tables) is an interesting case because: “the ecological inertia (resistance to external fluctuations) contained in some boreal ecosystems may provide more extensive buffering against climate change, resulting in”ecosystem-protected” refugia (Stralberg et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate, biodiversity and carbon storage\n\n\n\n\n\nSuraci et al. (2023) developed various spatially explicit indices to incorporate carbon storage, climate and biodiversity and applied them in the US. The climate index combines total carbon storage, climate accessibility, and climate stability. The biodiversity index combines: species richness, ecological integrity, and ecological connectivity. They integrate all of them into a combined index. “We found that existing PAs in the United States have relatively low overlap with the highest conservation value lands, regardless of the index used (10%–13% in CONUS, 27%–34% in Alaska), suggesting limited effectiveness of current protections but substantial opportunity for expanding conservation into high-value, unprotected areas. In unprotected landscapes, the highest value lands for addressing climate change generally diverged from those identified as most important for protecting biodiversity (22%–38% overlap, depending on index and geography). Our combined index reconciled these spatial trade-offs through high overlap with both the climate and biodiversity indices (66%–72%)” (Suraci et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity and traditional wildfoods\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigenous Peoples in their territories are facing challenges to their food sovereignty and food security (as reported for many countries; e.g., Swiderska et al. 2022). This is a critical biodiversity issue; it is estimated that 50,000 wild species are used by billions of people around the world (Fromentin et al. 2023). The broader definition of food security, goes beyond mere access to food (local economy, water quality and quantity), encompasses health indicators, nutrition, traditional hunting costs, and the broader subsistence economy. It sheds light on the intricate connections between food security and diverse aspects of community life. And, Indigenous Peoples in Canada also rely on wildlife for traditional food and multiple other uses (e.g., Kuhnlein & Turner 1991).\nFood security relates to the fundamental human right of access to food (United Nations 1948). Specifically, food security is achieved when a reliable supply of food is available to people in a region (Mbow et al. 2019). In historically ostracized and remote communities, food security is a critical issue (Salomon et al., 2020). The impact of colonial practices on indigenous people around the world has resulted in many communities losing their food sovereignty and security (Whyte, 2018, Swiderska et al. 2022). In a time of reconciliation, efforts to revitalize traditional practices and return rights to indigenous people must address food security issues (Chuenpagdee & Jentoft 2019).\nIndigenous communities face different and varying degrees of food security  (i.e., availability, access, utilization, and stability; Shafiee et al. 2022) , especially in remote areas (Kenny & Chan 2017). However, not all communities suffer from the same rates of food insecurity, even within similar ecological regions, for example about 25% of households in Western Alaska are food insecure compared to 69% in Nunavut (Chuenpagdee & Jentoft, 2019). In fact, Nunavut has the highest rate of food insecurity for any indigenous population living in a developed country (Council of Canadian Academies 2014). Culture, history, local practices, environmental change, logistics, and governance systems all play a role in food security outcomes. Community-based actions  (Domingo et al. 2021), protecting and restoring habitats (Pickzak et al. 2023) are key towards achieving food sovereignty and security and human wellbeing in local northern communities (Skinner et al. 2013).\nFreshwater fisheries\nGlobally, freshwater fisheries are a key source of food providing high quality protein and a key component of a healthy diet (Béné et al., 2016). Subsistence fisheries are meant to provide enough food for the fisher and their family or community. These small- scale fisheries are essential to food security for many communities but also support the culture and sense of place of many indigenous peoples (McClanahan et al. 2015). Typically, subsistence fisheries are more sustainable than large-scale commercial fishing but can be heavily impacted by these practices as they rely on the same stocks of fish (Béné et al. 2016). As such, many communities around the world are facing reduced catch as a consequence of declining stocks, threatening their food security and culture (Pauly et al. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreshwater fisheries\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\nWorldwide\nDescription:\nEvaluate the contribution of fisher’s indigenous and local knowledge (Silvano et al. 2023).\n156 cases based on 179 published studies on fishers’ knowledge of aquatic ecosystems worldwide (between 1974 and 2022), including several organisms (fish, turtles, etc) and multiple research topics (e.g., population biology, invasive species, modeling, etc.). (Silvano et al. 2023).\nGoals/targets (biodiversity conservation/human well-being):\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals\nStrengths:\nFishers’ Indigenous and local knowledge can broaden the available biodiversity/environmental indicators from conventional science to evaluate changes, Some of the examples they include are:\n- shifts in behavior\n- fish condition (‘skinny fish’)\n- weather patterns\n- water color\n- presence of associated species\n- sea-water salinity\nActions taken or suggested:\n- Integrate fisher’s indigenous and local knowledge into formalized management and conservation programs.\n- Overcome intellectual inertia and structural features of research funding, bureaucracies and management institutions.\n- Operationalize the interface between conventional science and ILK by participatory monitoring, citizen science, community science, and knowledge co-production.\n- Address limitations in conventional knowledge and ILK.\n\n\n\nForaging and hunting wild foods\nFauna and flora offer multiple sources of food, medicine, shelter, materials, forage, ceremonial symbols, among others to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. For instance, more than 35,000 plants are thought to be used by human cultures globally (Pironon et al. 2024) and the importance of traditional knowledge, cultural identity, dietary quality, wild food harvest, food insecurity, and biodiversity conservation have been evaluated in some regions (e.g., Campbell et al. 2021, Kennedy et al. 2022, Punchay et al. 2020, Ahmed et al. 2022).\nClimate change is expected to impact on spatio-temporal availability of wildfoods and the perceived change in species abundance by local communities (e.g., Schunko et al. 2022, Powell et al. 2023).\nMultiple approaches to address major threats have been proposed (Powell et al. 2023), including the weaving of multiple knowledge systems, sustainable foraging of wild foods (Teixidor et al. 2022), and support community-based participatory research and community-led planning actions (Domingo et al. 2021, Sotoyama Initiative, Mason et al. 2022) have been proposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of weaving multiple knowledge systems in monitoring biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\nGagnon et al (2023) bridged Indigenous and scientific knowledge to identify the mechanisms linking climate, caribou, and human capacity to satisfy cultural and subsistence needs in a human-caribou system offering a unique research environment. They bridged long-term scientific data and ILK to test the direct and indirect effects of regional temperature, snow conditions, icing events, and large-scale temporal changes associated with caribou demography on caribou distribution and the perceptions and behaviour of hunters.\nThey tested “the direct and indirect effects of regional temperature, snow conditions, icing events, and large-scale temporal changes associated with caribou demography on caribou distribution and the perceptions and behaviour of hunters”. Figure below shows “that cold temperatures and deep snow during Fall have strong effects on both caribou distribution and the perceptions of hunters about caribou availability, which in turn influence the decision to go hunting and the capacity of meeting needs in caribou” (Gagnon et al 2023)."

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).\nIntegrated assessment models (IAMs) have emerged as key tools for building and assessing long term climate mitigation scenarios and inform policy-making (Fuhram et al. 2019, Vaidyanathan 2021, van Beek et al. 2020). IAMs \"are coupled models of the global economic and climate systems, first developed to represent fossil fuel emissions from the energy system (Reister and Edmonds, 1977), and later expanded to include land use change and forestry emissions, as well as non-CO2 emissions (Di Vittorio et al., 2014)\" (Furhman et al. 2019). IAMs provide \"insights about the options available for, and the consequences of, possible strategies for long term greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, by simultaneously capturing the development of several interacting, relevant systems (e.g. energy, economy, land use)\" (Keppo et al. 2021). \n\nIn general, IAMs are spatially explicit and mathematical models, usually global in scope, sector oriented (e.g., Krey 2014) and originally designed to evaluate climate change scenarios (e.g., SSPs, IPCC 2021, Furhman et al. 2019) and SDGs (van Soest et al. 2019). \n\nBosetti et al. (2021) evaluated how IAMs were developed and used to respond to the main questions surrounding climate change and also the interconnection between climate policies and other sustainable development objectives.  \n\nWhat are the climate implications of a \"baseline\" or \"business as usual\" trajectory; that is, a scenario characterized by no meaningful action to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions?\nWhat techno-economic investments and strategies would achieve a given climate target at minimum cost?\nWhat is the \"optimal\" increase in temperature? \"Optimal\" is defined as the level of temperature increase that balances the cost of mitigating emissions with the benefit of the avoided climate damage.\nWhat are the multiple physical impacts associated with climate change?\n\nIAMs have been also developed to include other components from the human and natural systems.  And, there are also attempts to scale-down to regional, national (Schaeffer et al. 2020) and local levels (Guariso et al. 2016).\nStrength of an IAM\n\"The strength of an IAM is its ability to calculate the consequences of different assumptions and to interrelate many factors simultaneously, but an IAM is constrained by the quality and character of the assumptions and data that underlie the model. IAMs are based on a multitude of assumptions about the atmosphere and oceans, land cover and land use, economic growth, fossil fuel emissions, population growth, technological change, etc.\" (CIESIN 1995). As a result, CIESIN (1995) highlight IAMs limitations:\n\nThe systems modeled are large, complex, and chaotic.\nThe complexity of natural and social systems cannot be captured by IAMs.\nThe full consequences of policies considered will not be known for decades or centuries.\nOver this span of time, many surprises will occur.\nScientific knowledge is incomplete or absent in many areas.\nValues of human, animal, and plant life, health, and diversity are difficult to quantify.\n\nSome limitations\nSimilarly, Keppo et al. (2021) summarized some of the IAMs criticisms related to climate change-energy sector:\n\n\"IAMs have been criticized for neglecting actor heterogeneity, which plays an important role in societal transitions. Modelling the complexity of societal transitions involves representing mechanisms that lead to heterogeneous behaviour (e.g. norms, conventions, conflict, negotiation, strategic behaviour, resistance to change), local initiatives (local heterogeneity), actor interactions, and the evolving system level structures, including social and political processes, governance and institutions.\nIAMs have been criticized for the way they represent the economy. In particular, IAMs were criticized for relying on first-best economic assumptions of perfectly functioning markets omitting important aspects of real-world frictions with key implications for macroeconomic dynamics and hence least-cost assessment\nA major critique about IAMs concerns cost-effective climate change mitigation scenarios and the role of carbon pricing frameworks. The critique addresses various aspects of the political and socio-technical feasibility of transition scenarios related to carbon pricing. \nThe critique that climate mitigation scenarios derived with IAMs ignore interactions with other SDGs (Geels et al 2016) is unsubstantiated.\nModeller judgement has an important role in defining numerous details about how the system is modelled (e.g. what technologies to include/exclude), but such subjective decisions, often driven by non-epistemic values and norms, are rarely made explicit…, and the documentation process of IAMs and repeatability of IAM analysis have been criticized..\"\n\nTavoni & Valente (2022) highlighted \"the crucial role of epistemic uncertainty in IAMs\", arguing that \"the normative components of models, more than the physical and socio-techno-economic ones, are the most fraught by uncertainty and yet the least understood\". And, Alshehri et al. (2024) proposed a \"novel uncertainty assessment protocol for integrated ecosystem services-life cycle assessments\".\nBeck et al. (2020) divided into IAMs modelling assumptions (mostly data assumption) for biomass with carbon capture and storage and whether multiple IAMs include and communicate these assumptions. They found that \"IAMs are transparent in communicating wider system and biomass resource availability assumptions. This transparency decreases as we move into modelling details…\" and some assumptions are better communicated than others (Beck et al. 2020)\nWho is working on IAMs\nThis is an active field of research and scientists, practitioners and organizations are working to develop new IAMs to fit specific purposes and/or tackle main criticisms. The Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium (IAMC) is an organization of scientific research institutions that pursues scientific understanding of issues associated with integrated assessment modeling and analysis (UN 2018). A review of global-nature models from The Network for Greening Financial System is also available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of IAMs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firsts models to respond to questions related with climate change were the Integrated Model for the Assessment of the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) and the Atmospheric Stabilization Framework (ASF). Then, to describe narratives of the future, a group of IAMS were developed and improved, including: IMAGE (Roelfsema et al. 2022), ASF, MESSAGE, MARIA and AIM.\nFor instance, GLOBIOM assesses competition for land use between agriculture, bioenergy, and forestry sectors. Some countries have developed a regional version of GLOBIOM to simulate regional economic partial equilibrium and land use dynamics (GLOBIOM-Brazil, Soterroni et al. 2018 and Soterroni et al. 2019) to evaluate \"whether existing and expected national policies will allow Brazil to meet its net-zero GHG emissions pledge by 2050\" and \"the role of nature-based solutions, such as the protection and restoration of ecosystems, and engineered solutions, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage\" (Soterroni et al. 2023).\nLeclère et al. (2020) used \"the land-use component of four IAMs to generate spatially and temporally explicit projections of land-use change for each scenario\", including The Asia Pacific Integrated Model (AIM, Fujimori et al. (2014) and Fujimori et al. (2017)), GLOBIOM (e.g., Havlik et al. 2014), Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE; e.g., Stehfest et al. 2014) and MagPIE (Pop et al. 2014). They found that global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion could be reversed if action was immediate, and of unprecedented ambition and coordination. MEDEAS tries to integrate global biophysical and socioeconomic constraints (e.g., Capellán et al. 2020). \nEcological modelers have also developed some IAMs to accommodate and evaluate questions related to biodiversity futures (e.g., Harfoot et al. 2013) and conservation alternatives. For instance, GLOBIO-Species tool is available to assess the impacts of human pressures on the distribution and species population size of and GLOBIO-ES can help to calculate the current state, trends and possible future scenarios of ecosystem services globally, running.\nVeerkamp et al. (2020) evaluated projections of future changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services under four environmental scenarios, using two IAMs: IMAGE-GLOBIO and CLIMSAVE-IAP, respectively. They results showed \"that (i) climate and land use change will continue to pose significant threats to biodiversity and some ecosystem services, even in the most optimistic scenario; (ii) none of the four scenarios achieved overall preservation of BES in Europe; and (iii) targeted policies (e.g. on climate change, biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management) and behavioural change (e.g. reducing meat consumption, water-saving behaviour) reduced the magnitude of BES loss\".\n\n\n\nIAMs\nPurpose\nPartner organization\nSome applications\n\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM)\nThe AIM assesses policy options for stabilizing the global climate, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, with the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and avoiding the impacts of climate change\nNational Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Kyoto University, Mizuho Information & Research Institute and several research institutes in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan\nClimate change mitigation measures can affect agricultural markets and food security\nFujimori et al, (2022)\n\n\nBrazilian Land Use and Energy System (BLUES)\n(See MESSAGE)\n\nCOPPE/UFRJ (Cenergia), Brazil\n\n\n\nGlobal Change Analysis Model (GCAM)\nGCAM is a market equilibrium model with a global scope and operates from 1990 to 2100 in five-year time steps.

Scenario assessment\n“Scenarios capture different policy options being considered by decision makers, which are then translated by models into consequences for nature, nature’s benefits to people and quality of life”. (IPBES 2016).\nScenario assessment has been implemented separately in multiple component of the biosphere such as biodiversity (species, communities, and ecosystems) and physical features (lakes, permafrost, peatlands, etc.) and also ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage, crops, water, etc.). Recently, integrating multiple components and systems into scenario assessment has been possible due to the development of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).\nMost of the assessments are global in scope and not all are spatially explicit; however there is a trend to perform assessments at multiple scales (regional, national and rarely local), including spatial explicit outputs.\nBelow some examples.\nThis section is under construction!\nSee case studies in biodiversa+\n\nBiodiversityPhysical featuresEcosystem servicesIntegrated Assessment Models (IAMs)\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\nSpatially explicit scenarios of expected changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services have recently been documented through several studies (e.g., Newbold 2018, Chaudhary& Moores 2018).\n\n\n\nBiodiversity Scenario Assessment\n\n\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\n\n\n\nPhysical features assessment\n\n\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\nEcosystem services tools such as InVEST™, ARIES, and Co$tingNature are available to quantify trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services.

Also, it would have the largest synergy between carbon storage, water purification, and habitat quality, compared to other scenarios” (Sun et al. 2019).\n\n\n\nApproach proposed by Li et al. (2023) to evaluate carbon storage under future scenarios of land use, (1) Data preparation and preprocessing. (2) The PLUS model predicted land utilization changes for 2030 under the trend continuation scenario, the eco-friendly scenario, and the comprehensive development scenario. (3) Using the InVEST model, the space-time allocation of carbon storage under various development scenarios from 2000 to 2030 was evaluated.

IAMs provide \"insights about the options available for, and the consequences of, possible strategies for long term greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, by simultaneously capturing the development of several interacting, relevant systems (e.g. energy, economy, land use)\" (Keppo et al. 2021). \n\nIn general, IAMs are spatially explicit and mathematical models, usually global in scope, sector oriented (e.g., Krey 2014) and originally designed to evaluate climate change scenarios (e.g., SSPs, IPCC 2021, Furhman et al. 2019) and SDGs (van Soest et al. 2019). \n\nBosetti et al. (2021) evaluated how IAMs were developed and used to respond to the main questions surrounding climate change and also the interconnection between climate policies and other sustainable development objectives.  \n\nWhat are the climate implications of a \"baseline\" or \"business as usual\" trajectory; that is, a scenario characterized by no meaningful action to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions?\nWhat techno-economic investments and strategies would achieve a given climate target at minimum cost?\nWhat is the \"optimal\" increase in temperature? \"Optimal\" is defined as the level of temperature increase that balances the cost of mitigating emissions with the benefit of the avoided climate damage.\nWhat are the multiple physical impacts associated with climate change?\n\nIAMs have been also developed to include other components from the human and natural systems.  And, there are also attempts to scale-down to regional, national (Schaeffer et al. 2020) and local levels (Guariso et al. 2016).\nStrength of an IAM\n\"The strength of an IAM is its ability to calculate the consequences of different assumptions and to interrelate many factors simultaneously, but an IAM is constrained by the quality and character of the assumptions and data that underlie the model. IAMs are based on a multitude of assumptions about the atmosphere and oceans, land cover and land use, economic growth, fossil fuel emissions, population growth, technological change, etc.\" (CIESIN 1995). As a result, CIESIN (1995) highlight IAMs limitations:\n\nThe systems modeled are large, complex, and chaotic.\nThe complexity of natural and social systems cannot be captured by IAMs.\nThe full consequences of policies considered will not be known for decades or centuries.\nOver this span of time, many surprises will occur.\nScientific knowledge is incomplete or absent in many areas.\nValues of human, animal, and plant life, health, and diversity are difficult to quantify.\n\nSome limitations\nSimilarly, Keppo et al. (2021) summarized some of the IAMs criticisms related to climate change-energy sector:\n\n\"IAMs have been criticized for neglecting actor heterogeneity, which plays an important role in societal transitions. Modelling the complexity of societal transitions involves representing mechanisms that lead to heterogeneous behaviour (e.g. norms, conventions, conflict, negotiation, strategic behaviour, resistance to change), local initiatives (local heterogeneity), actor interactions, and the evolving system level structures, including social and political processes, governance and institutions.\nIAMs have been criticized for the way they represent the economy. In particular, IAMs were criticized for relying on first-best economic assumptions of perfectly functioning markets omitting important aspects of real-world frictions with key implications for macroeconomic dynamics and hence least-cost assessment\nA major critique about IAMs concerns cost-effective climate change mitigation scenarios and the role of carbon pricing frameworks. The critique addresses various aspects of the political and socio-technical feasibility of transition scenarios related to carbon pricing. \nThe critique that climate mitigation scenarios derived with IAMs ignore interactions with other SDGs (Geels et al 2016) is unsubstantiated.\nModeller judgement has an important role in defining numerous details about how the system is modelled (e.g. what technologies to include/exclude), but such subjective decisions, often driven by non-epistemic values and norms, are rarely made explicit…, and the documentation process of IAMs and repeatability of IAM analysis have been criticized..\"\n\nTavoni & Valente (2022) highlighted \"the crucial role of epistemic uncertainty in IAMs\", arguing that \"the normative components of models, more than the physical and socio-techno-economic ones, are the most fraught by uncertainty and yet the least understood\". And, Alshehri et al. (2024) proposed a \"novel uncertainty assessment protocol for integrated ecosystem services-life cycle assessments\".\nBeck et al. (2020) divided into IAMs modelling assumptions (mostly data assumption) for biomass with carbon capture and storage and whether multiple IAMs include and communicate these assumptions. They found that \"IAMs are transparent in communicating wider system and biomass resource availability assumptions. This transparency decreases as we move into modelling details…\" and some assumptions are better communicated than others (Beck et al. 2020)\nWho is working on IAMs\nThis is an active field of research and scientists, practitioners and organizations are working to develop new IAMs to fit specific purposes and/or tackle main criticisms. The Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium (IAMC) is an organization of scientific research institutions that pursues scientific understanding of issues associated with integrated assessment modeling and analysis (UN 2018). A review of global-nature models from The Network for Greening Financial System is also available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome examples of IAMs\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firsts models to respond to questions related with climate change were the Integrated Model for the Assessment of the Greenhouse Effect (IMAGE) and the Atmospheric Stabilization Framework (ASF). Then, to describe narratives of the future, a group of IAMS were developed and improved, including: IMAGE (Roelfsema et al. 2022), ASF, MESSAGE, MARIA and AIM.\nFor instance, GLOBIOM assesses competition for land use between agriculture, bioenergy, and forestry sectors. Some countries have developed a regional version of GLOBIOM to simulate regional economic partial equilibrium and land use dynamics (GLOBIOM-Brazil, Soterroni et al. 2018 and Soterroni et al. 2019) to evaluate \"whether existing and expected national policies will allow Brazil to meet its net-zero GHG emissions pledge by 2050\" and \"the role of nature-based solutions, such as the protection and restoration of ecosystems, and engineered solutions, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage\" (Soterroni et al. 2023).\nLeclère et al. (2020) used \"the land-use component of four IAMs to generate spatially and temporally explicit projections of land-use change for each scenario\", including The Asia Pacific Integrated Model (AIM, Fujimori et al. (2014) and Fujimori et al. (2017)), GLOBIOM (e.g., Havlik et al. 2014), Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE; e.g., Stehfest et al. 2014) and MagPIE (Pop et al. 2014). They found that global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion could be reversed if action was immediate, and of unprecedented ambition and coordination. MEDEAS tries to integrate global biophysical and socioeconomic constraints (e.g., Capellán et al. 2020). \nEcological modelers have also developed some IAMs to accommodate and evaluate questions related to biodiversity futures (e.g., Harfoot et al. 2013) and conservation alternatives. For instance, GLOBIO-Species tool is available to assess the impacts of human pressures on the distribution and species population size of and GLOBIO-ES can help to calculate the current state, trends and possible future scenarios of ecosystem services globally, running.\nVeerkamp et al. (2020) evaluated projections of future changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services under four environmental scenarios, using two IAMs: IMAGE-GLOBIO and CLIMSAVE-IAP, respectively. They results showed \"that (i) climate and land use change will continue to pose significant threats to biodiversity and some ecosystem services, even in the most optimistic scenario; (ii) none of the four scenarios achieved overall preservation of BES in Europe; and (iii) targeted policies (e.g. on climate change, biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management) and behavioural change (e.g. reducing meat consumption, water-saving behaviour) reduced the magnitude of BES loss\".\n\n\n\nIAMs\nPurpose\nPartner organization\nSome applications\n\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM)\nThe AIM assesses policy options for stabilizing the global climate, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, with the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and avoiding the impacts of climate change\nNational Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Kyoto University, Mizuho Information & Research Institute and several research institutes in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan\nClimate change mitigation measures can affect agricultural markets and food security\nFujimori et al, (2022)\n\n\nBrazilian Land Use and Energy System (BLUES)\n(See MESSAGE)\n\nCOPPE/UFRJ (Cenergia), Brazil\n\n\n\nGlobal Change Analysis Model (GCAM)\nGCAM is a market equilibrium model with a global scope and operates from 1990 to 2100 in five-year time steps.

Rapid thawing can accelerate carbon release (Turestky et al. 2019, IPCC 2019) and contribute to decreasing the Peat-C accumulation rate of the entire pan-Arctic region (Zhao et al. 2022). McLaughlin and Webster (2013) describe the potential climate change effects on peatland carbon in the HJBL, as follow: “(1) in northern ecoregions accelerated permafrost thawing and wetter peat enhances methane emissions and (2) in southern ecoregions increased evapotranspiration and drier peat accelerates carbon dioxide losses through peat decomposition (and possible fire).” When drained or burned for agriculture (as wetlands often are) they go from being a carbon sink to a carbon source, releasing into the atmosphere centuries of stored carbon (UN Environment programme).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Land Surface Model is designed to identify the distribution of permafrost.\nYokohata et al. (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThawing of permafrost\n\n\n\n\n\nThawing permafrost\nThawing permafrost might alter biophysical dynamics (e.g., surface subsidence (thermokarst) and water-logging), changes in surface wetness and wetland area (Cooper et al. 2017) across large areas in northern regions (e.g., Miner et al. 2022, Murdoch et al. 2021, Turetsky et al. 2020, Turestky et al. 2007) and might pose environmental threats (e.g., Langer et al. 2023). “A warming climate can induce environmental changes that accelerate the microbial breakdown of organic carbon and the release of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane” (Schuur et al. 2015). Harris et al. (2023) have shown large losses following permafrost the in peatlands in western Canada and Du et al. (2021) showed the potential role of peatlands in reducing the effect of permafrost thaw due to “peat’s thermal insulation effect on permafrost due to its low thermal conductivity and high moisture content”. \nModels to evaluate permafrost thawing along with other models (e.g., carbon storage, biodiversity) might offer a more realistic picture of the HJBL dynamics and provide valuable information for spatial planning and decision-making. For instance, Earth System Models shows self-sustained thawing of permafrost (Randers & Goluke 2020), the Global Land Surface Model is designed to identify the distribution of permafrost (Yokohata et al. 2020), and the Northern Ecosystems Soil Temperature model (NEST) is “a process-based model to simulate permafrost thermal regimes by combining the strength of existing permafrost models and land surface process models” (Zhang et al. 2003, Zhang et al. 2008), among others. Spence et al. (2020) developed and applied “a conceptual framework for assessing vulnerability of Northern Canadian water resources to permafrost thaw. For this study, water resources are defined as surface hydrological and aquatic chemistry regimes that are characterized by typical water budgets, and water chemistry concentrations and loads”.

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are statistical, correlating spatial distribution (occurrence or abundance data across locations) with environmental and geographic variables (spatial environmental data) describing those locations (see Elith & Leathwick 2009, for a review). SDMs use spatial environmental data to make inferences about species’ range limits and habitat suitability; conceptually they are mapping components of the species’ ecological niche through space and time. These models now hold a prominent place within biodiversity science because computing facilities now allow easy use of spatial data layers (GIS software) and remote sensing products that describe geographic environmental structure can be combined with large data sets of species occupancy (e.g. obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility).\nAn SDM model can be used to predict the species’ distribution across a large geographic extent under different scenarios of environmental (e.g., climate) change. They are widely used in conservation assessments comparing species distributions under different scenarios both in target-seeking and exploratory scenarios (see Scenarios section).\nSDMs have been implemented for multiple purposes including assessing prioritization scenarios to protect biodiversity (Berteaux et al. 2018, Eckert et al. 2023), linking local to regional conservation (Albert et al. 2017, DeLuca et al. 2023), biological invasions (Lezner et al. 2019), impacts on ecosystems and human well-being (Pecl et al. 2017) and evaluating critical habitat for species at risk (Leston et al. 2023), linking biodiversity and ecosystems function (Antunes et al. 2024), among many others.\nMultiple studies have identified climate refugia (Michalak et al. 2018) under multiple climatic scenarios (Stralberg et al. 2018, AdaptWEST) for various taxonomic groups in North America (Stralberg et al. 2017). Conservation strategies (Belote et al. 2017, Ranius et al. 2023) to inform conservation planning (Carroll et al. 2017, Stralberg et al. 2020, Stralberg et al. 2020, Droboski et al. 2021) and the implications for costs and configuration of protecting areas (Lawler et al. 2020) under climate change scenarios have been also evaluated.  \n\nStralberg et al. (2020) developed a conservation ranking map for North America to identify priority areas, including climatic macro-refugia for trees and birds (e.g., Stralberg et al. 2018), microrefugia (using environmental heterogeneity surrogates, that is topography, e.g., Ackerly et al. 2010) and climatic corridors (Carroll et al. 2018, Anderson et al. 2023).

They can be used to model single  (Gould et al. 2019) and multi-species occupancy ( Devarajan et al. 2020).

Multiple studies have applied this approach using site species composition data obtained from the Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems (PREDICTS) database. This work repeatedly finds average declines in local diversity, relative abundance and functional group diversity due to human pressures (land use intensity, human density) on land cover (Newbold et al. 2015, 2016).

Additional approaches to assess patterns and drivers of beta diversity at different spatial scales have been proposed (see He et al. 2023). General dissimilarity models go beyond single species and predict community-level features such as community composition and species turnover or richness (Ferrier & Guisan 2006).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/\nApproaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Dissimilarity Models (GDMs)\nFerrier et al. (2007),\nRosauer et al. (2013),\nMokany et al. (2022)\nDi Marco et al. (2019)\nFitzpatrick et al. (2011)\nRobroeck et al. (2017)\nGarner et al. (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessments\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/\nApproaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nIntegrative Assessment Models (IAMs)\nSchipper et al. (2019)\nJanse et al. (2015)\nKuiper et al. (2014)\nSoto-Navarro et al. (2020)\nAlkemade et al. (2009)\nKok et al. (2018)\nKuiper et al. (2014)\n\n\n\nIntegrative Assessment Models (IAMs)\nPurvis et al. (2018)\nMillard et al. (2021),\nNewbold (2018)\nSoto-Navarro et al. (2020)\nValdez et al. (2023)\n\n\n\nSpecies Threat Abatement and Restoration\n\nMair et al. (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated community models\n\n\n\n\n\nZipkin et al. (2023)\n\n\n\nEcosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Vegetation Models\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are equilibrium process-based models that simulate the potential distribution of generalised types of natural vegetation on the basis of the physiological properties of plant groups, average seasonal climate and hydrological conditions and the direct physiological effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (i.e., increased water-use efficiency by plants). Like Global Climate Models, GVMs are used to understand how climate change will drive changes in the distribution of major plant taxa (e.g., boreal, temperate and tropical forests, grasslands, shrubland, tundra).\n\nLeemieux & Scott (2005) used two GVMs models, BIOME3 (Haxeltine & Prentice 1996) and Mapped Atmosphere Plant Soil System (MAPSS) (Neilson 1995) to project the future equilibrium outcome of vegetation across Canada’s protected area network at the time. They found over 40 percent of Canada’s protected areas are projected to experience a change in biome type as a result of climate change, the results of this study contribute to a growing body of research that questions the capacity of existing protected area networks to fulfil this objective in an era of global climate change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand cover and land use changes models\n\n\n\n\n\nAn array of spatially explicit models has been developed to simulate and predict the possible future outcomes of land cover and land use changes. For instance, the CLUE model is a dynamic, spatially explicit, land cover and land use change model used in multiple applications such as deforestation, land degradation, urbanization, land abandonment and integrated assessment of land cover change and urban growth (Zhou et al. 2016), among others. For the conversion of land use and its effects at a small region extent the CLUE-S model has been developed (Gao et al. 2021). The Dyna CLUE integrates demand-driven changes in land area with locally determined conversion processes (Verburg & Overmars, 2009). \nCellular Automata Markov simulation models have been also used to quantitatively simulate and predict land use change  (Kang et al. 2019, Beroho et al. 2023, Leta et al. 2021,Kang et al. 2019, Lu et al. 2019, Debnath et al. 2023, Zhang & Li 2013).\nMore sophisticated models like Future Land Use Simulation model (FLUS, Li et al. 2017,; Zhang et al. 2020) simulate multiple land use scenarios; and the  GMOP-PLUS model which analyzes changes in ecological and economic benefits and carbon emissions by optimizing the quantitative structure and spatial layout of land use in different scenarios (Meng et al. 2023).\nCombining models and their strengths are also usual, for instance Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) is a top-down approach that can solve problems with conflict objectives, however it is not spatially explicit, so it has to be coupled with other models such as, for instance the Dynamic Conversion of Land Use and its Effect (Dyna, Wang et al. 2018).\nMethods to downscaling global land use have also been developed (West et al. 2014, Yourek et al. 2023) to fit in Integrative Assessment Models (IAMs, Pereira et al. 2010, Harfoot et al. 2013).\nHarmonized sets of past and present land cover and land use methods are needed to simulate future scenarios (Hurt et al. 2006, Hurt et al. 2011). Assessing uncertainties in LCLUC projections  (Prestele et al. 2016) is also fundamental for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem change.\n\nSome models (CLIMATESAVE Integrated Assessment Platform, GLOBIO) are used to evaluate multiple drivers of change (LCLUC and CC) that might affect biodiversity and ecosystem services (Veerkamp et al. 2020).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nConversion of Land Use and its Effects\nCLUE model\nCLUE-s: Zhou et al. (2016), Gao et al. (2021)\nDyna CLUE: Verburg and Overmars (2009)\nRakotoarinia et al. (2023)\nEl-Khoury et al. (2014)\n\n\nCellular Automata Markov simulation models\nKang et al. (2019),\nBeroho et al. (2023),\nLeta et al. (2021),\nKang et al. (2019),\nLu et al. (2019),\nDebnath et al. (2023),\nHe et al. (2023),\nYang et al. (2016)\nWang (2012)\n\n\nAgent-based models\nMatthews et al. (2007),\nBartkowski et al (2020)\nMcLane et al. (2011)\nFreeman et al. (2009)\n\n\nFuture Land Use Simulation model (FLUS)\nLi et al. (2017)\nCuellar & Perez (2023)\nZhang et al. (2020)\nXu et al. (2022)\n\n\nPatch-generating land use simulation (PLUS)\nLiang et al. (2021)\nMeng et al. (2023)\nMutale & Qiang (2024)\n\n\n\nMulti-Objective Programming (MOP) model\nShi et al. (2023)\n\n\n\nMOP and Dyna\nWang et al. (2018)\n\n\n\nGlobal models use land cover classes to estimate both past and current changes.\nHurtt et al. (2011),\nWinkler et al. (2021)\n\n\n\nFuture land use changes under multiple Climate SSPs and RCPs scenarios.\nChen et al. (2020)\n\n\n\nLANDIS Forest landscape Model\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating LU & IAMs\nHasegawa et al. (2017)\n\n\n\nGLOBIOM\nSoterroni et al. (2022)\n\n\n\nCAPS\nMeiyappan et al. (2014)\n\n\n\nCLUMondo\nvan Asselen & Verburg (2013)\n\n\n\nGlobal Change Analysis Model GCAM\n\n\n\n\nGLM\nHurt et al. (2006)\n\n\n\nIMAGE\nLetourneau et al. (2012)\nSleeter et al. (2012)\n\n\n\nLandSHIFT\nSchaldach et al. (2011)\n\n\n\nMagPIE\nLotze-Campen et al. (2010)\n\n\n\n\nAwais et al. (2023)\nKrey et al. (2020)\nFricko et al. (2017)\n\n\n\nMachine learning\nStepinski (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-to-end ecosystem models (E2E)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese models include multiple biophysical, social and economic components and the full cycle of processes to predict changes in the state of ecosystems in response to multiple drivers and management scenarios (e.g., Cuddington et al. 2013).

    "text": "IntroductionModelsToolsPartnersDatasetsGuidance for action\n\n\nSome of the strategies for climate change mitigation are aimed to protect, restore and/or manage forested ecosystems that sequester and store high amounts of carbon (e.g., Kauppi et al. 2022, Nunes et al. 2019, Fargione et al. 2018, Armenteras et al. 2015, Lemprière et al. 2013), providing some directions for policy and opportunities in carbon markets  (e.g., Anderson et al. 2017, but see Venter & Koh 2012,  West et al. 2023). However, soil carbon storage (Spawn et al. 2020), an important global asset in northern ecosystems, in particular peatlands in Canada (Sothe et al. 2021, Harris et al. 2021), is crucial to maintain global climate stability  (Chaplin-Kramer et al. 2022, Neugarten et al. 2023).\nMeasuring and modeling the past and current redistribution and storage of anthropogenic carbon sources among the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere is key to understanding the global carbon cycle and informing global decision making (Friedlingstein, 2020; Global Carbon Project). In terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands also called “...organic soils”, “bogs”, “fens”, “swamps” and “mires”, are the world’s most carbon-dense terrestrial ecosystems. \nPeatlands are formed from partially decomposed plant remains that have accumulated over thousands of years under conditions of waterlogging. Peat soils hold an estimated 650 billion tonnes (Gt = Pg) of carbon on only 3 percent of the Earth’s land surface – a carbon store that is equal in magnitude to the amount of carbon in the Earth’s vegetation, and more than half of the carbon in the atmosphere (Xu et al. 2010, Page et al. 2011, Dargie et al. 2017)….” FAO-UN (2020). The Hudson James Bay Lowlands (HJBL) is the second largest peatland in the world, which extends over ~370,000 km2 (Harris et al. 2021, Packalen et al. 2014, WCS story maps). Nichols & Peetet (2019) argued that the estimate of total northern peat carbon stocks could be from 545 Gt to 1,055 Gt of carbon.\n“One-quarter of the world’s northern peatlands (~1.1 million km2), and the world’s largest peatland C stock (~150 Gt), is located in Canada (Joosten 2009, Xu et al. 2018, Hugelius et al. 2020)…only ~10% of peatlands in Canada are currently within protected areas”  (Harris et al. 2021). Soil carbon is critically important in the northern hemisphere and in particular for Canada (Schalermann et al. 2014, Beaulne et al. 2021).\nSpatial variability in carbon stored in peatlands complicates upscaling to regional estimates. For instance “regions characterized by warmer and wetter conditions stored the most C as peat” (Packalen et al. 2016). Combining field measurements, satellite data, hydrological and climate data is essential to get better spatially-explicit estimates and reduce uncertainty (seeSothe et al. 2022, Balogun et al. 2023). Similarly, implemeting soil carbon simulation models and identifying areas of improvement would reduce uncertainty in carbon dynamics under climate change (Varney et al. 2022).\n\n\nHere we present three general approaches for quantifying carbon storage for ecosystem services assessments and show how these three approaches could be adapted to account for peatland carbon dynamics. All these approaches rely on local site-specific field surveys for calibration and validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratify and multiply\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approach relies on first stratifying or partitioning the study area into multiple unique land cover or ecosystem types (Goetz et al. 2009, Sharp et al. 2020, Martínez-López et al. 2019). A reference or average carbon stock value is assigned to each cover type. The area of each cover type is then multiplied by the cover type’s associated reference carbon stock value.\nMany ecosystem service modeling platforms use a Stratify & Multiply approach, including the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services, ARIES (Martínez-López et al. 2019) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, InVEST (Natural Capital Project, 2023). Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys to derive reference carbon stock values and detailed site-specific land cover maps that account for environmental gradients that might influence carbon stock changes (e.g., climate, soil characteristics, species composition, management, degradation, elevation, site history, wetland type, ecozone, etc.).\n\nCarbon emissions can be assessed in a similar way. For example, maps of peatland types can be combined with estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange and Methane emission rates compiled for each peatland type and region (Webster et al. 2018).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nStratify and multiply\nGoetz et al. (2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect remote sensing\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second approach, Direct Remote Sensing, uses a statistical or machine learning model to relate soil carbon field measurements to remotely sensed observations and other geospatial layers (Goetz et al. 2009, Sothe et al. 2021). The Direct Remote Sensing approach captures spatial variability of carbon within land cover classes, which is often missed with the Stratify and Multiply approach. Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys for model calibration and validation as well as local site-specific geospatial layers for covariates (e.g., topography, slope, soil type, wetland type, ecosystem type, soil characteristics, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon stock maps can be differentiated to track changes over time. Another new approach relies on multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate changes in peatland elevation after a wildfire (Reddy et al. 2015). Peatlands are becoming more susceptible to wildfires due to lowering water tables under climate change and development (Turetsky et al. 2015).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nDirect remote sensing\nGoetz et al. (2009)\nSothe et al. (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass balance models\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third approach, Mass balance models, accounts for all key carbon pools and flows of carbon between these pools over time (GFOI 2016, Bona et al. 2020). Mass balance models can track changes in carbon due to natural processes such as growth and decay as well as drivers of change including land use, wildfires, water table depth, and permafrost thaw.\nMass balance models are especially useful for understanding peatland carbon dynamics because they can account for the balance between the uptake of carbon and the emission of methane (Bona et al. 2020). Furthermore, these models can track changes in carbon due to increases in peatland disturbances, including droughts, permafrost thaw, and fires under climate change (Bona et al. 2020, Harris et al. 2022). When peatland permafrost thaws, previously frozen carbon can be decomposed, thereby releasing carbon dioxide and methane (Hugelius et al. 2020).\nMany modeling approaches have been implemented to estimate peatland carbon stocks in Canada including (1) the Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) which accounts for wildfire disturbances but currently not permafrost thaw (Bona et al. 2020, although permafrost thaw is currently being implemented), (2) dynamic global ecosystem models that incorporate permafrost dynamics (Chaudhary et al. 2017), and (3) inventory-based models (Hugelius et al. 2020)  that can also account for abrupt permafrost thaw (Turetsky et al. 2020). Best practices include integrating local site-specific field data for calibration and validation as well as remotely sensed data for accurate spatially explicit disturbance detection (e.g., Zhou et al. 2021, Bona et al. 2020, Shaw et al. 2021).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nMass balance Models\nGFOI, (2016)\nBona et al. (2020)\nHarris et al. (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional models to evaluate vulnerabilities and monitoring peatlands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjections, vulnerabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nProjections/\nvulnerabilities\nMüller & Joos (2021),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping & monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nMapping and monitoring\nMinashy et al. (2023),\nHastie et al. (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo identify yet\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople/Organization/Institution\nTopic\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Waterloo (CanPeat)\nCanadian Model for Peatlands (CaMP)\nCan-Peat: Canada’s peatlands as nature-based climate solutions\n\n\nECCC (Kelly Bona)\n\n\n\nWWF\nMapping\n\n\nWCS\nMapping\n\n\nUniversity of Toronto (Sarah Finkelstein)\n\n\n\nUniversity of Leads\nPEATMAP\n\n\nStockholm University (Bolin Centre for Climate Research)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn construction!!!\n\n\n\nDescription\nRepository and Layers\nExtent,\nFormat,\nResolution,\nProjection\nReference\n\n\n\n\nMaps of northern peatland extent, depth, carbon storage and nitrogen storage\nStockholm University (Bolin Centre for Cliamte Research)\nHistel_fraction\nHistel_minerotrophic\nHistel_ombrotrophic\nHistel_SOC_hg_per_sqm\nHistel_TN_gram_per_sqm\nHistosol_fraction\nHistosol_minerotrophic\nHistosol_ombrotrophic\nHistosol_SOC_hg_per_sqm\nHistosol_TN_gram_per_sqm\nMean_potential_peat_depth_cm\nNorhtern hemisphere,\nGeoTiff,\n10 Km,\nWorld Azimuthal Equidistant projection,\nHugelius et al. (2020)\n\n\nA map of global peatland extent created using machine learning (Peat-ML)\nZenodo\nPeatland fractional coverage\nGlobal,\nNetCDF (Network Common Data Form),\n0.0833 (~1Km),\nlonlat\nMelton et al. (2022)\n\n\nPEATMAP: Refining estimates of global peatland distribution based on a meta-analysis\nResourceWatch\nGitHub\nRDLP\nGlobal (by continents)\nShapefile\n25m-1000m\nProjected (ESRI:54034 - World_Cylindrical_Equal_Area)\nXu et al. (2018)\n\n\nGlobal Peatlands\nGlobal Forest Watch\nCombine various data sets to delineated peatlands\nAvailable in tiles\nGlobal\nTIF\n30 * 30m\nEPSG:4326 - WGS 84\nGlobal Forest Watch\n\n\n\nExample\n\nPeat ML global peatland_extent from Melton et al. (2022)\nPeat cores Hugelius et al. (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a need to optimize monitoring/sampling in the region by identifying priority sites where data is needed to improve model performance and reduce uncertainty.\nPartnerships with local NGOs, universities/researchers, and indigenous communities are needed to support the implementation of an observing system."

    "text": "Some of the strategies for climate change mitigation are aimed to protect, restore and/or manage forested ecosystems that sequester and store high amounts of carbon (e.g., Kauppi et al. 2022, Nunes et al. 2019, Fargione et al. 2018, Armenteras et al. 2015, Lemprière et al. 2013), providing some directions for policy and opportunities in carbon markets  (e.g., Anderson et al. 2017, but see Venter & Koh 2012,  West et al. 2023). However, soil carbon storage (Spawn et al. 2020), an important global asset in northern ecosystems, in particular peatlands in Canada (Sothe et al. 2021, Harris et al. 2021), is crucial to maintain global climate stability  (Chaplin-Kramer et al. 2022, Neugarten et al. 2023).\nMeasuring and modeling the past and current redistribution and storage of anthropogenic carbon sources among the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere is key to understanding the global carbon cycle and informing global decision making (Friedlingstein, 2020; Global Carbon Project). In terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands also called \"...organic soils\", \"bogs\", \"fens\", \"swamps\" and \"mires\", are the world's most carbon-dense terrestrial ecosystems. \nPeatlands are formed from partially decomposed plant remains that have accumulated over thousands of years under conditions of waterlogging. Peat soils hold an estimated 650 billion tonnes (Gt = Pg) of carbon on only 3 percent of the Earth's land surface – a carbon store that is equal in magnitude to the amount of carbon in the Earth's vegetation, and more than half of the carbon in the atmosphere (Xu et al. 2010, Page et al. 2011, Dargie et al. 2017)….\" FAO-UN (2020). The Hudson James Bay Lowlands (HJBL) is the second largest peatland in the world, which extends over ~370,000 km2 (Harris et al. 2021, Packalen et al. 2014, WCS story maps). Nichols & Peetet (2019) argued that the estimate of total northern peat carbon stocks could be from 545 Gt to 1,055 Gt of carbon.\n\"One-quarter of the world's northern peatlands (~1.1 million km2), and the world's largest peatland C stock (~150 Gt), is located in Canada (Joosten 2009, Xu et al. 2018, Hugelius et al. 2020)…only ~10% of peatlands in Canada are currently within protected areas\"  (Harris et al. 2021). Soil carbon is critically important in the northern hemisphere and in particular for Canada (Schalermann et al. 2014, Beaulne et al. 2021).\nSpatial variability in carbon stored in peatlands complicates upscaling to regional estimates. For instance “regions characterized by warmer and wetter conditions stored the most C as peat” (Packalen et al. 2016). Combining field measurements, satellite data, hydrological and climate data is essential to get better spatially-explicit estimates and reduce uncertainty (seeSothe et al. 2022, Balogun et al. 2023). Similarly, implemeting soil carbon simulation models and identifying areas of improvement would reduce uncertainty in carbon dynamics under climate change (Varney et al. 2022)."

    "text": "2. Three approaches for quantifying carbon storage\nHere we present three general approaches for quantifying carbon storage for ecosystem services assessments and show how these three approaches could be adapted to account for peatland carbon dynamics. All these approaches rely on local site-specific field surveys for calibration and validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStratify and multiply\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approach relies on first stratifying or partitioning the study area into multiple unique land cover or ecosystem types (Goetz et al. 2009, Sharp et al. 2020, Martínez-López et al. 2019). A reference or average carbon stock value is assigned to each cover type. The area of each cover type is then multiplied by the cover type’s associated reference carbon stock value.\nMany ecosystem service modeling platforms use a Stratify & Multiply approach, including the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services, ARIES (Martínez-López et al. 2019) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, InVEST (Natural Capital Project, 2023). Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys to derive reference carbon stock values and detailed site-specific land cover maps that account for environmental gradients that might influence carbon stock changes (e.g., climate, soil characteristics, species composition, management, degradation, elevation, site history, wetland type, ecozone, etc.).\n\nCarbon emissions can be assessed in a similar way. For example, maps of peatland types can be combined with estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange and Methane emission rates compiled for each peatland type and region (Webster et al. 2018).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nStratify and multiply\nGoetz et al. (2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect remote sensing\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second approach, Direct Remote Sensing, uses a statistical or machine learning model to relate soil carbon field measurements to remotely sensed observations and other geospatial layers (Goetz et al. 2009, Sothe et al. 2021). The Direct Remote Sensing approach captures spatial variability of carbon within land cover classes, which is often missed with the Stratify and Multiply approach. Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys for model calibration and validation as well as local site-specific geospatial layers for covariates (e.g., topography, slope, soil type, wetland type, ecosystem type, soil characteristics, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon stock maps can be differentiated to track changes over time. Another new approach relies on multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate changes in peatland elevation after a wildfire (Reddy et al. 2015). Peatlands are becoming more susceptible to wildfires due to lowering water tables under climate change and development (Turetsky et al. 2015).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nDirect remote sensing\nGoetz et al. (2009)\nSothe et al. (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass balance models\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third approach, Mass balance models, accounts for all key carbon pools and flows of carbon between these pools over time (GFOI 2016, Bona et al. 2020). Mass balance models can track changes in carbon due to natural processes such as growth and decay as well as drivers of change including land use, wildfires, water table depth, and permafrost thaw.\nMass balance models are especially useful for understanding peatland carbon dynamics because they can account for the balance between the uptake of carbon and the emission of methane (Bona et al. 2020). Furthermore, these models can track changes in carbon due to increases in peatland disturbances, including droughts, permafrost thaw, and fires under climate change (Bona et al. 2020, Harris et al. 2022). When peatland permafrost thaws, previously frozen carbon can be decomposed, thereby releasing carbon dioxide and methane (Hugelius et al. 2020).\nMany modeling approaches have been implemented to estimate peatland carbon stocks in Canada including (1) the Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) which accounts for wildfire disturbances but currently not permafrost thaw (Bona et al. 2020, although permafrost thaw is currently being implemented), (2) dynamic global ecosystem models that incorporate permafrost dynamics (Chaudhary et al. 2017), and (3) inventory-based models (Hugelius et al. 2020)  that can also account for abrupt permafrost thaw (Turetsky et al. 2020). Best practices include integrating local site-specific field data for calibration and validation as well as remotely sensed data for accurate spatially explicit disturbance detection (e.g., Zhou et al. 2021, Bona et al. 2020, Shaw et al. 2021).\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nMass balance Models\nGFOI, (2016)\nBona et al. (2020)\nHarris et al. (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjections, vulnerabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nProjections/\nvulnerabilities\nMüller & Joos (2021),\nRanders & Goluke (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping & moniotirng\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment of Status\nSome Global and Canadian examples of model implementation.\n\n\n\nModels/Approaches\nHave they been used?\nIn Canada?\n\n\n\n\nProjections/\nvulnerabilities\nMinashy et al. (2023),\nHastie et al. (2022)"

Grill et al. (2019) defined free-flowing rivers as “...rivers where natural aquatic ecosystem functions and services are largely unaffected by changes to fluvial connectivity allowing an unobstructed exchange of material, species, and energy within the river system and surrounding landscapes”. \n\nGrill et al. (2019) developed a global status for rivers (free-flowing rivers), including multiple metrics of human impact on these networks. They summarized their results within a hierarchical set of basins and subbasins (see HydroBASINS) in what they call the Connectivity Status Index.  Confluvio (2020) developed a river connectivity index for hydrological catchments in Canada.

Finn & Jackson (2011), in Australia, proposed “three challenges to conventional environmental flow assessments that, if met, will improve the ability of water resource planning to address indigenous interests.\n- “The first challenge is to recognize that in an indigenous context a different suite of species may be considered important when compared to those valued by other stakeholders. \n- The second challenge is to accommodate a different set of management objectives in environmental flow allocation.\n- The third and arguably most theoretically challenging task is for environmental flow assessments to take into account indigenous worldviews and the quality of people–place relationships that are significant in indigenous cultures”.

Spatial prioritization\nMultiple approaches exist to prioritize terrestrial, marine and freshwater areas, that best represent one (e.g., protect as many species as possible, e.g., Ceballos & Ehrlich 2006) or multiple facets of biodiversity (e.g., Brum et al. 2017). These approaches are usually developed to achieve global conservation targets (e.g., conserve at least 30% of land by 2030; Dinerstein et al., 2019; Belote et al. 2021, Carroll & Noss 2021) from regional (e.g., Mallory & Boyce 2019) to national (e.g., Belote et al. 2021) and global scales (e.g., Strassburg et al. 2020), depending on the conservation scope and data availability.\nIn Canada, spatial prioritization has been used for biodiversity conservation for multiple biodiversity facets and also to address multiple environmental threats. Some of them have been implemented and have formal institutional support. For instance:\n\nIndigenous Protected and Conserved Areas (IPACs; Shwan-Fletcher et al. 2021, Tran et al. 2019, Garnett et al. 2018, Moola & Roth 2018).\nImportant Birds Areas (IBAs).\nKey Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): from species to ecosystems.\nOther Effective area-based Conservation Measures (see Canada) .\nCritical Ecosystem Areas (operational methodology proposed by Venegas et al. 2023).\nEndemic species for conservation (Kraus et al. 2022).\nSpecies at risk:\n\nPan-Candian approach 2023\nSARA-COSEWIC,**\naquatic species at risk**\nCritical Habitat for Species at Risk National Dataset - Canada, visualize it here)\nWoodland Caribou, Boreal population (Rangifer tarandus caribou) ECCC\n\nEcological restoration (Currie et al. 2023).\nForest change, forest extent, drives, and fire alerts (Canada- Global Forest Watch).\nCarbon storage (Harris et al. 2021).\nCanada watersheds reports.\nWetlands: (ECCC 2016; Ontario, Wulder et al. 2018).\nPeatlands (WCS).\nFree-flowing rivers (Grill et al. 2019; for Canada see this, WWF).\nAI and Biodiversity (GPAI 2022, AI for Good) .\nWorld Economic Forum, LIFECLEF, Thompson 2023).\n\nBiodiversity, climate mitigation, and human communities (Bateman et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA topic for further discussion: analytical products from spatial prioritization\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes from Simo Ferrier:\nIt’s critically important to distinguish between two quite different types of analytical products here: 1) mapping of the relative priority of spatial units for implementation of a given action, to help inform decisions made within a highly messy, incremental decision-making process requiring consideration of lots of other ever-changing, context-specific scale-dependent values, factors and constraints which can’t be effectively defined and quantified up-front; and 2) mapping of a discrete subset of spatial units selected to meet a set of targets, as efficiently and effectively as possible, through some form of optimisation or pseudo-optimisation. These two products play quite different roles in assessment and planning  - a difference discussed in Ferrier & Drielsma (2010). Mapping of relative priorities allows flexibility in incremental decision-making processes, by providing information on the potential value of all units in a region. This flexibility is largely lost in mapping of discrete areas proposed or selected for action. A given spatial unit is either included or excluded from the areas selected. Yet, because these selected areas together represent just one of many possible solutions which could have achieved a similar biodiversity outcome for the region, the potential contribution that an excluded unit could actually make to achieving this outcome is hidden from view. It is tempting to interpret the different colours on a Zonation map as conveying relative levels of priority for action. But these colours instead represent the order in which spatial units have been selected to generate a single optimal solution for the region and set of targets concerned – i.e. they represent nested subsets of this single solution. This would be appropriate if the relevant planning process will allow this solution to be implemented in a highly top-down deterministic manner, but far less appropriate for processes that operate in a messier incremental manner, and therefore require greater flexibility, and greater consideration of other values and factors, in decision-making."

In general, land use allocation (also sometimes referred to as land use planning (Stewart et al., 2004)) is a type of resource allocation and can be defined as the process of allocating different activities or uses (e.g., agriculture, residential land, recreational activities, conservation) to particular areal units within a region (Cao et al., 2012)” (Kaim et al 2018).\nSee Bartkowski et al. (2020) for Aligning Agent-Based Modeling With Multi-Objective Land-Use Allocation."

    "text": "IntroductionToolsPartnersDatasetsGuidance for action\n\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\nIdentifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services and evaluating how multiple conservation goals might be achieved efficiently are part of the systematic conservation planning framework that requires spatial prioritization tools (Moilanen et al. 2022, Kukkala & Moilanen 2012, Moilannen et al. 2006). Spatial prioritization methods can simultaneously balance the needs of many biodiversity features or ES, aiming at solutions that combine different spatial needs. Commonly used tools such as Zonation and Marxan are being used for multicriteria spatial prioritization that includes multiple ecosystem services and measures of biodiversity and ecological integrity (e.g. connectivity).\n\n\n\nSchematic illustration of the process of spatial prioritization, with entry points for connectivity considerations (From Kukkala & Moilanen 2017). Spatial prioritization methods can simultaneously balance the needs of many biodiversity features or ES, aiming at solutions that combine different spatial needs.\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nThere are quantitative approaches and associated optimization tools used to identify spatial conservation priorities: minimum-set problem and maximal-coverage problem (Moilanen et al. 2009, McIntosh et al. 2017, Alagador & Cerdeira 2020). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarxan\n\n\n\n\n\nMarxan software is the most widely used software in protected area planning (Watts et al. 2009, Delavenne et al. 2012, Gallo et al. 2020, Watts et al. 2020, Watts et al. 2021). It solves the minimum-set problem, which is to achieve conservation targets (e.g., protect 20% of each habitat type) while minimizing the resources expended (Ball et al., 2009). To achieve this, it uses an algorithm to minimize an objective function with the following objectives: achieve the conservation targets, minimize the overall cost, and achieve a specified degree of spatial compactness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZonation\n\n\n\n\n\nZonation software (Moilanen et al. 2009, Moilanen et al. 2022) is also commonly used for protected area planning (Delavenne et al., 2012, Leathwick et al. 2008). It is used to solve the maximal coverage problem, as opposed to the minimum-set problem that Marxan solves. The maximal coverage problem aims to maximize the biodiversity benefit for a fixed budget (Moilanen et al. 2009).\nZonation produces a complementarity-based and balanced ranking of conservation priority over the entire landscape (Moilanen et al. 2005), rather than satisfying specific targets at minimum cost (Moilanen et al. 2005, Moilanen et al. 2009,  Moilanen et al. 2021, Moilanen et al. 2022). The priority ranking is produced by iteratively removing the grid cell or planning unit that leads to smallest aggregate loss of conservation value, while accounting for total and remaining distributions of features, weights given to features, and feature-specific connectivity. Least valuable cells (e.g. a few common species occurring) are removed first, while the most important cells for biodiversity (e.g. high species richness and species occurrence) are kept till the end. These calculations are illustrated in the table on the next page.\nZonation has been used to identify priority areas for multiple ecosystem services (Chan et al. 2011), biodiversity (Albuquerque & Beier 2015), and connectivity (Kukkala & Moilanen 2017, Albert et al. 2027). Other studies have used Marxan, as a first step, to identify priority areas under multiple scenarios, and then the InVEST tool to estimate the conservation cost of these priority areas (Zhang and Li 2022).\n\nIf used appropriately, Zonation and Marxan often deliver similar spatially explicit priorities for protected areas (Delavenne et al. 2012). Although these tools originally did not account for uncertainty, both have now been updated to explicitly include probabilistic information concerning occurrence, as well as other types of uncertainty (Klein et al. 2013, Moilanen et al. 2006, Tulloch et al., 2013, Srikrishnan et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPTAIN\n\n\n\n\n\nConservation area prioritization through artificial intelligence (CAPTAIN, Silvestro et al. 2022) is a tool to optimize biodiversity protection through AI and “optimizes a conservation policy based on static or dynamic biodiversity monitoring towards user-defined targets (such as minimizing species loss) and within the constraints of a limited financial budget, and used it to explore, through simulations and empirical analyses, multiple previously identified trade-offs in real-world conservation and to evaluate the impact of data gathering on specific outcomes” (Silvestro et al. 2022). ML and its subset Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been developed to overcome Marxan and similar methods limitations, that is they were designed to optimize a one-time policy (but see Welch et al. 2019 on how they configure Marxan to operate dynamically overtime).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-objective linear programming problem\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multi-objective linear programming problem is “a mathematical formulation for the Expand Protection multi-objective linear programming problem. The objective of this problem is to maximize the minimum summed conservation value of prioritized planning units, across the set of conservation objectives” (Martin et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nTools\nSupporting\nOrganization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nRepository and Layers\nExtent,\nFormat,\nResolution,\nProjection\nReference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\n\nIdentify spatial conservation priorities by weaving traditional knowledge and science with western science (e.g., Noble et al. 2020).\nCreate a working group of multiple partners representing all knowledge systems to identify priority areas for assessment in the HJBL for: \n\nmultiple facets of biodiversity and expected shifts in species’ distributions\ntrade-off and synergies among multiple ecosystem services \nphysical features important in the region (e.g., lakes, rivers, basins, peatlands)."

This Figure depicts the strength of linkages between categories of ecosystem services and components of human well-being that are commonly encountered and includes indications of the extent to which it is possible for socioeconomic factors to mediate the linkage. (For example, if it is possible to purchase a substitute for a degraded ecosystem service, then there is a high potential for mediation.) The strength of the linkages and the potential for mediation differ in different ecosystems and regions. In addition to the influence of ecosystem services on human well-being depicted here, other factors—including other environmental factors as well as economic, social, technological, and cultural factors—influence human well-being, and ecosystems are in turn affected by changes in human well-being.).\n\n\nEcosystem services are the product of ecosysmem processes that the biophysical system support.\n\n\n\nBiophysical, social-economic and cultural system framing ecosytsem services (typology for the classification of ecosystem services from Groot et al. 2002). Notice this is an simplified example of some drivers of change, management and governance (hexagons); as well as, some biophysical elements (orange boxes) interacting (black thin arrows) to sustain ecological processes (dark green boxes) that in turn offer ecosystem services (magenta boxes), affecting human well-being (light green boxes).

This model type can and has been used to generate realistic representations of factors such as preferences, social interactions, policies, property rights and markets (Schlüter et al. 2017, Huber et al. 2018). ABM are usually spatially and temporally explicit, and they can account for path dependencies and (social–technological) lock-ins.

These tools can integrate complex interactions and beneficiaries (Thierry et al. 2021) under various scenarios (e.g., climate change, land cover change, urban growth, management interventions, etc.; see for instance: Brown et al. 2015).\nOther tools are also available such as The Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator (LUCI, and its next generation named Nature Braid).  An example of its functionality is reported by Pereira et al. (2023) and for Nature-Based Flood Water Management in Vietnam (Dang et al. 2021). The Social Values for Ecosystem Services (SolVES)tool has also been used by the USGS service.\nBelow we describe the major spatially-explicit ecosystem services platforms (InVEST™, ARIES and Co$tingNature) and the ensemble of carbon storage models as a way to enhance accuracy compared with single models. We also present some case studies highlighting the use of these models and tools for ecosystem services accounting with other spatial prioritization tools such as Marxan and Zoation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInVEST™\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“InVEST™ is a suite of free, open-source software models used to map and value the goods and services from nature that sustain and fulfill human life.  If properly managed, ecosystems yield a flow of services that are vital to humanity, including the production of goods (e.g., food), life-support processes (e.g., water purification), and life-fulfilling conditions (e.g., beauty, opportunities for recreation), and the conservation of options (e.g., genetic diversity for future use).” (Natural Capital Project, and a review by Mukhopadhyay et al. 2024).\nOne of the InVEST models is the Carbon Storage and Sequestration model that incorporates four carbon pools (i.e., aboveground living biomass, belowground living biomass, soil, and dead organic matter) and a land cover map (see how it works).\nThe Carbon Storage and Sequestration model is a very simple model that maps carbon pools within a land cover map:\nData inputs: Land cover and land use map (LCLU) along with stocks in carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter). \nOutputs: Raster metric (tons per hectare (t/ha)). \nLimitations reported from InVEST™: \n\n“Limitations of the model include an oversimplified carbon cycle, an assumed linear change in carbon sequestration over time, and potentially inaccurate discounting rates.”\n“Biophysical conditions important for carbon sequestration such as photosynthesis rates and the presence of active soil organisms are also not included in the model.\n“...because the model relies on carbon storage estimates for each LCLU type, the results are only as detailed and reliable as the LCLU classification used and carbon pool values supplied.”\n“...the model is that it does not capture carbon that moves from one pool to another.”\n\n\nThe Natural Capital Project tracks publications around the world that have used InVEST (Mandle, Lisa and Natural Capital Project 2023, database), reporting 204 publications (out of 1205, since 2008) using the Carbon storage and sequestration model. In North America, 114 publications were in the US and 1 in Canada by Doyle et al. (2013) (it proposes an Ecosystem Potential Index for Canada (EPIC) in the boreal region; however, a close look at the study shows that they mentioned InVEST but did not apply it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“ARIES is an artificial intelligent modeler rather than a single model or collection of models.

The result is a detailed, adaptive, and dynamic assessment of  how nature provides benefits to people.” (ARIES, see Villa et al. 2014 for methods).\nThe ARIES team is developing an interactive platform for the United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting for Ecosystem Accounting (ARIES for SEEA, see also UN-SEEA). “The current Explorer functionalities are restricted to assessing ecosystem 1. extent (based on the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology), 2. condition (for forest ecosystem types), and 3. selected ecosystem services in physical and monetary units using basic models as a starting point. The outcomes can be analyzed and downloaded to further explore the results (either through a spreadsheet or GIS software)” (ARIES for SEEA, see UN Global Platform to access the application).\nThe SEEA is well-positioned to support the Global Biodiversity Framework under the auspices of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) (see SEEA and the CBD).  SEEA has also created a new subgroup on Accounting for Biodiversity in the SEEA EEA, “to better understand the connection of biodiversity from ecosystem extent and condition to ecosystem services, economic activity and well-being, and vice versa, as well as to support policy and decision making concerning the conservation and enhancement of biodiversity at all levels including ecosystems”.\nData inputs: Land cover type link to carbon storage data\nOutputs: Spatially explicit areas \nLimitations: From Villa et al. (2014): “The question of how completely such nonlinear dynamics can be realistically represented by ES assessment methods remains paramount.”\nExamples of weaving multiple knowledge systems in SEEA\nCollaborative engagement is recognized by the System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA), and two actions are recommended: \n(1) including recognition of Indigenous values as a new item on the SEEA-EA research agenda, and;\n(2) that Indigenous Peoples be part of the UN processes governing the development of the SEEA-EA (Normyle et al. 2022.), see also Normyle et al. 2023).\nThere are some examples investigating Indigenous Peoples’ perspective on the potential application of SEEA-EA to support cultural and environmental management.  For instance, Normyle et al. (2022) working with IP in Australia “highlight that while the SEEA-EA may be a valuable tool for empowering Indigenous people and supporting the management of their lands and seas, there are areas where the SEEA-EA needs to be broadened to better reflect cultural values, and the services to ecosystems provided by Indigenous peoples”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo$tingNature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Co$tingNature is a sophisticated  web-based spatial policy support system for natural capital accounting and analyzing the ecosystem services provided by natural environments (i.e. nature’s benefits), identifying the beneficiaries of these services and assessing the impacts of human interventions. The Policy Support System (PSS) incorporates detailed spatial datasets at 1-square km and 1 hectare resolution for the entire World, spatial models for biophysical and socioeconomic processes along with scenarios for climate and land use. The PSS calculates a baseline for current ecosystem service provision and allows a series of interventions (policy options) or scenarios of change to be used to understand their impact on ecosystem service delivery. We do not focus on valuing nature (how much someone is willing to pay for it) but rather costing it (understanding the resource e.g. land area and opportunity cost of nature being protected to produce the ecosystem services that we need and value)” (Co$tingNature, Policy Support Systems-PSS).\nCo$tingNatureMapBeta provides results from the Co$tingNature Policy Support System globally (10km resolution) and regionally (1km resolution) for current baseline and selected scenarios,  including 18 ecosystem services, biodiversity, current and future human pressure; and nature’s contribution to achieving the SDGs, individually and collectively. Some modules of the Co$tingNature have been used to simulate future land cover change scenarios to understand its effect on biodiversity (Brown et al. 2015).\nData inputs: Multiple layers, including land cover, climate, human pressure, soil carbon\nOutputs: Spatially explicit areas (e.g., nature’s contribution to SDGs targets)\n\n\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\n\n\n\nPurpose\nTools\nSupporting\nOrganization\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem Services Assessment\nEcosystem Services Toolkit\n\n\n\nReview in Canada\nEcosystem services decision support tools\nKerr et al. (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nRepository and Layers\nExtent,\nFormat,\nResolution,\nProjection\nReference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is under construction!\nWe recommend multi-objective approaches that combine ecosystem services and multiple facets of biodiversity (e.g., biodiversity and carbon storage co-benefits) under multiple global, national, local scenarios for the HJBL.\nBiodiversity and carbon storage\n\nIdentify overlapping and complementary spatial priorities at regional, biome, and national levels. Then, identify opportunities for spatial planning that coincide with these overlaps to inform policy, goals, and targets at multiple levels.\nCombine knowledge from multiple ongoing analyses.

    "text": "7. Workshop findings\nGEO BON and Parks Canada convened a two-day workshop in Montreal (Oct 16-17, 2023) with primary knowledge holders from three main partners groups: GEO BON experts, regional experts and indigenous scholars and partners (e.g., Parks Canada, ECCC, Indigenous communities). Some of the main conclusions from this workshop were:\nWorking together\n\nThere is a strong desire among all partners to work together to find ways to protect biodiversity and manage ecosystem services in the HJBL. \n\nThe words that come before all else:\n\nExpressing gratitude and emphatic connection to all of creation. “The words address the People, Earth Mother, The Waters, Fish, Plants, Food Plants, Medicine Herbs, Trees, Birds, Four Winds, Thunderers, Sun, Grandfather Moon, Stars, Enlightened Teachers, and The Creator. Each element of the natural world is spoken to and thanked for their contributions to all life. These words bind us and promote empathy with all creation” (Donna Long). \n\nKnow the “100-year vision” to anticipate change\n\nThere is a need to preserve the Omushkego Traditional Territory for future generations and appreciate the diverse contributions of all engaged groups.\nThere is also a global need to protect carbon-rich areas to provide climate stability on the planet.\n\nRelationships first - build trust\n\nThe necessity of building trust and understanding indigenous methodologies, primarily passed through oral tradition.\nIt is imperative that all stakeholders and rights holders are known and recognized.\nFind a common language in relation to building shared understanding and trust of the words we use..\n\nRebuild what has been lost\n\nThe significance of acknowledging the differences in knowledge systems, rebuilding lost elements such as language, and understanding why certain knowledge is preserved in indigenous communities.\n\nRecognize the unique priorities for each community\n\nAll needs, priorities and expectations from indigenous peoples and local communities should be expressed, heard and respected by all partners. For instance, the value of wetlands beyond agricultural purposes is seen as a way to express how valued they are to communities.\n\nKnowledge to action is a social exercise\n\nThis is a process gathering multiple partners, it takes time to design, implement and get results (most likely generations), including multiple opinions/ideas/views, trade-offs and persistence.\nHowever, start by doing things! Planning can take a long time. So, identify steps we can take now, which may lead to improved engagement with Indigenous communities.\nWe can start building a monitoring system, with what we already know, and then begin monitoring that responds to specific community needs. And then this monitoring feeds into the planned monitoring system.\nPartners must acknowledge that there are some things Indigenous People cannot accommodate, that sharing knowledge is not for granted.\nExplore ways to effectively communicate among partners (words matter)\nBraiding knowledge as key navigators.\nCollaborative approach, community engagement, and a step-by-step implementation to address the entire system’s needs incrementally, ensuring credibility, relevance, and resilience in the process. \n\nMultiple ways to gather information\n\nEngaging with First Nations communities to gather traditional knowledge and narratives concerning ecosystem changes. For instance, phenology studies, such as the CreeGeo Hub, which records temporal changes, indicating shifts in timing and utilizing language-based indicators.\n\nWeaving knowledge to build policies\n\nThere is a need to bring people together across scientific fields, decision-makers, and Indigenous communities and in particular to help Indigenous communities find a way to be in the same room as policymakers.\n\nBack to top"

    "text": "8. Guidance for action\n\nA system to inform multiple partnersHow can these tools support the HJBL initiative?\n\n\n\nThe main ideas compiled from the workshop to weave multiple knowledge systems and move forward this initiative are:\n\n\n\n1. Indigenous lead system\n\nEnsure Indigenous participation and engagement in decision making and management is at the heart of inclusive and just conservation in Canada and worldwide (Henri et al. 2021, Bowles et al. 2022, TWC, McGregor et al. 2023).\nStart with local expertise, acknowledging the significance of local knowledge and the necessity of providing essential tools, capacity building and funding, among others.\n\n\n\n2. Healthy and resilient system\n\nThat is, people having access to secure goods and water, agency in decisions, mental, physical, and spiritual health.\nRisk can be anticipated, understood, and communicated.\nNature is valued across scales (across communities and globally).\n\n\n\n3. Participation of multiple partners\n\nConvening experts from various fields, including modelers, remote sensing specialists, and field scientists.\nThe role of indigenous mental models in defining monitoring systems and networks, employing fuzzy cognitive mapping to conceptualize relationships.\nEmphasis on cross-cultural lexicons and the contrast between indigenous and western models.\nMultiple partners setting achievable common goals, leveraging some community based opportunities and maximizing the mutual benefits of cooperation by integrating multiple strategies .\n\n\n\n4. A network architecture for the system\n\nBuy-in from many stakeholders.\nLegitimacy, salience and credibility.\nContinuity as some nodes get more or less involved.\nTakes many perspectives into consideration (indigenous, provincial, federal, etc.).\nApolitical collaboration space.\nEngage others as it grows.\n\n\n\n5. Implement multi-objective and multiscale approaches\n\nThe multiscale nature of biodiversity and drivers of change (social, economic, and cultural) affect the provision of ecosystem services and also determine the implementation of conservation planning strategies. Thus, it is strategic to integrate multiple objectives in conservation planning (e.g., multiple facets of biodiversity, and multiple ecosystems services under multiple scenarios) and also evaluate the effect of implementing strategies at different scales (local, regional, national, and global).\nManaging multiple interconnected biophysical features in a region and responding to multiple needs and expectations, by including their commonalities and trade-offs.\n\n\n\n6. Multi-prong/thematic/holistic approach\n\nIndigenous communities emerged as key holders of critical knowledge on traditional wildlife use, emphasizing the importance of their insights in understanding and managing resources for sustenance.\nProtecting peatlands for their carbon storage potential offers many co-benefits (e.g., water quality protection, water provision, flood alleviation and mitigation, food security, biodiversity).\nApplying the best monitoring practices for observing ecosystem change so that they support detection and attribution of the causes for change.\nFood security: the broader definition of food security, going beyond mere access to food, encompassing health indicators, traditional hunting costs, and the broader subsistence economy, shedding light on the intricate connections between food security and diverse aspects of community life. Food security concerns in a peatland context are more closely aligned with biodiversity rather than agriculture.\nIt’s about more than food, it is about nutrition and access (local economy, access, water, health).\nField data (e.g., soil cores, measuring plant biomass, eddy covariance stations, gas flux chambers) alongside remote sensing and modeling approaches (e.g., estimating spatial variability of carbon stocks to inform where to conserve, to model peatland depth, to model disturbances: fires, permafrost thaw). Using paleoclimate records of past warmer, drier, wetter and/or cooler conditions as well as regional analogs (i.e., from the Western boreal) is a useful approach to improve predictive models of future changes in response to impacts.\n\n\n\n7. Integrating bottom-up and top-down approaches\n\nEvaluating how global initiatives (CBDs and SCGs goals and targets) are received and potentially applied in a region; and also what are their most likely implications (benefits and trade-offs) in local and national policies and management actions.\nUsing participatory approaches identify and localize relevant global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Shared Socioeconomic  Pathways (SSPs) relevant to the HJBL and articulate them tolocal socioeconomic pathways or co-create these local scenarios by weaving multiple knowledge systems and collaborating with multiple partners to identify their needs and expectation.\n\n\n\n8. Build for the long-term\n\nIdentify challenges in long-term standardized monitoring and opportunities for the use of mixed information sources for new models, including AI applications, highlighting the value of both qualitative and quantitative information in addressing these biodiversity and ecosystem services challenges.\nLinking action also to markets and regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\n9. Proactive planning\n\nThe importance of considering the precautionary principle, which suggests acting with the best available knowledge even in the presence of uncertainty.\nAvoiding having to restore areas where there should not have been activity in the first place.\nIdentification and protection of key priority areas within the HJBL, considering multiple biophysical, social, economic and cultural aspects. For instance, areas crucial for carbon storage, taking into account their resilience, sensitivity and vulnerability to safeguard against potential threats.\nCompile what we already know because it will inform what data we might need.\nConsider the social dynamics of how a decision is made.\nTargeting specific data, simplifying messages, and leveraging existing information.\n\n\n\n10. Capacity building\n\nSupporting Indigenous-led processes, acknowledging diverse scientific practices, and integrating monitoring and adaptive management.\nSupport local initiatives (e.g., Cree GeoHub) by providing resources to make it fully operational and relevant to all partners needs and expectations.\nImplement a long term strategy to weave multiple knowledge systems.\nIdentify a strategy to deal with information as it grows in time (in different areas and multiple biophysical and socioeconomic components).\nImplement a strategy to integrate data collection, monitoring, modeling and multi-partners’ decision making at multiple spatial and temporal scales.\n\n\n\n11. Communication strategies among partners\n\nKnowledge is passed through oral traditions.\nThe importance of understanding the different types of information for diverse audiences.\nUse a range of ways of communicating and sharing knowledge of biodiversity change (over time and across the HBJBL. Embed this into participation and engagement in the activities that the Biodiversity Observation Network supports.\nFinding a common language in relation to local words for nature and how locals view,  benefit and value nature to ensure we avoid dis-respect, but also we develop shared understanding based on full awareness of terms and language use.\n\n\n\n12. Integrating remote sensing, community-based monitoring and modelling\n\nUsing a coordinated implementation of remote sensing, community-based monitoring, experts modeling techniques is strategic in large and inaccessible areas like the HJBL; and the historical and day to day knowledge of Indigenous People and local communities.\n\n\n\n13. Data sovereignty\n\nThere are some concerns about therisks associated with data sharing, challenges in data interoperability, and the adaptation of models from other regions to the HJBL’s context.\n\n\n\n14. Combining quantitative data analysis, and storytelling in oral tradition\n\nStorytelling and oral histories emerged as a method to communicate changes in the environment.\n\n\n\n15. Forecasting and scenarios\n\nNeed more information on how development in this region (past, present, and future) will impact carbon storage (e.g., creation of roads, mining, hydro, etc.). Need to communicate that because of ongoing climate change and other forms of environmental change, restoration to previous ecological functions may be very difficult and extremely expensive.\nIntegrating monitoring and forecasting models.\n\n\n\n16. Aligning conservation and biodiversity goals with rights of Indigenous Peoples land and resources rights is required in any process that might reach a vision of living in harmony with life on Earth. Returning to place-based approaches that are empowered by Indigenous governance and knowledge systems could “meet the interwoven goals of biodiversity conservation, social equity, and environmental justice for which we are legally and morally accountable” (Kobluk et al. 2024).\n\n\n17. Implementing the two-eyed seeing approach (i.e., bringing diverse knowledge systems together on an equal footing (Bartlett, Marshall, & Marshall 2012)) to address signals of long-term social, ecological and biophysical change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Partners’ vision and collaboration strategy\n\nIdentify a shared vision and collaboration strategy; address the challenges and potential solutions for implementing this strategy.\n\n\n\n19. Co-design a system\n\nListen first -learn from traditional knowledge & answer people’s needs.\nSystems thinking points to the interconnectedness of parts.\nscenarios and forecasts.\nTake a whole system approach, linking diversity to ecosystem functions and services (benefits to people). Monitoring effectively to capture change in the way biodiversity mediates carbon.\nCommunity is central (engage youth, build trust, ensure continuity).\nChange is pervasive and fast (culture, knowledge, climate, species distributions).\nTraditional Knowledge in the form of oral histories could provide evidence for changes in disturbance rates (e.g., permafrost thaw, fires) and identify synergies between carbon and other co-benefits, including biodiversity, water quality, etc.\nThe need to bring together knowledge in hand – a baseline knowledge description weaving together different types of knowledge (tacit and explicit) and models (taxonomic and functional diversity, ecosystem process, drivers etc.), and identify what is needed (where, how often, for whom).\nEmbrace and develop multiple views and models of biodiversity change relevant to the HBJBL, that can be informed by the knowledge we have to guide observations and monitoring. Consider change in short term events (fires, floods, disease etc.) as well as longer term trends.\nAcknowledge the different scales of change and link to causes (distant and local factors mediating change) that can be framed to support qualitative and quantitative\nIn designing this monitoring framework, we need to consider reconciliation, decolonization, and return of land.\nConsider conducting a participatory scenario analysis.\nConsider creating decision trees that link datasets to potential decisions, contexts, and needs.\n\n\n\n20. Co-design and establish a comprehensive sampling network.\n\nThe landscape’s vast variation and diverse features, both spatially and temporally, underscored the need for a sampling network encompassing various locations and factors of interest.\nThe importance of designing a network that can capture multiple signals and information sources from natural systems and local communities, enabling a comprehensive understanding.\nThis region is highly dynamic across time (e.g., daily, seasonally, annually) and heterogeneous across space. Therefore, long-term monitoring is needed.\nMethod selection depends on the decisions we seek to inform.\nLocal community involvement is key to combat challenges for conducting research in this region (e.g., need for on-site researchers to avoid equipment being destroyed by polar bears). Local expertise is important. Knowledge and interest are there, if given the resources needed.\nUpdatable integrated forecasting component using a combination of predictive trade-off models and simple indicators of state that can help focus efforts to places that are worth it both short and long term.\n\n\n\n21. Cree GeoHub as a tool for compiling, analyzing and synthesizing data\n\nBuild and curate knowledge with the CreeGeo Hub.\nMap potential ecosystem services in the region.\nStudy the impacts of resource extraction.\nUse existing toolkits made for purpose (BON in a Box) to create reusable scripts that are usable by people with and without expertise. This will help initiate the data integration/acquisition process and predictions.\nMonitoring in this region requires a participatory process.\n\n\n\n22. Funding\n\nIdentify needs, priorities and deadlines.\nEach community already knows the dominant problems (e.g., impacts of mining and/or hydro on fish populations).\nTraditional Knowledge on local hydrology should be documented.\nLeverage current funding (2.5 years) to set up and access more funding (private, public, NGO) while acknowledging funding constraints and opportunities.\nKeep a diverse range of perspectives in mind through an iterative process which includes global priorities (CC, fire risk), as they can be used to access federal and NGO funding.\nConsider private funding / philanthropy where the values and motivations of the finance providers align with those of the local communities.\n\n\n\n23. Start with some key case studies\n\nImmediate implementation of pilot projects, testing potential solutions or management options, might provide early evidence to move forward and scale up most suitable and cost-benefit options.\nDevelop a project register - list of ‘shovel-ready’ projects that can be delivered but don’t have funding allocated at present (to ensure preparedness for opportunities when finance is presented).\n\n\n\n24. Capacity building for all partners\n\nDesign and implement deep mapping techniques, and monitoring systems rooted in Traditional Knowledge.\nDo not lead with the data, but rather focus on outcomes and stories of change.\nThe network requires a full-time central team to keep the network alive and connected, potentially also including a member in each node. These facilitators are essential to build trust and be known by others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top"

The Cree Geoportal is a key data and knowledge hub and can form the focus for an observatory for the HJBL supported by other multiple initiatives in the region.\n\n\n2. GEO BON provides a framework to guide the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\n\n3. The Canadian Consortium for Arctic Data Interoperability (CCADI) can provide ethically open, accessible, and comprehensive digital resources to the broadest possible audience of data users.\n\n\n4. Create a permanent and funded multi-partner’s body to co-design a system by identifying who is doing what and where.\n\n\n5. Align global, regional and local biodiversity and sustainable goals among partnersworking and living in the region (see Nicholson et al. 2021); and, also to balance management objectives (Siegel et al. 2023). Making global targets local Flitcroft et al. (2024).\n\n\n6. Aligning goals requires not only identifying those that are robust (e.g., Williams et al. 2020) but leveraging some community based opportunities (Esmail et al. 2023), identifying common gaps among partners, and maximizing the mutual benefits of cooperation by integrating multiple strategies (O’Bryan et al. 2023) and achievable. For instance, the “Learning and Knowledge Hubs for Natural Climate Solutions”-ECCC initiative is aimed to “identify and fund research organizations that will host Learning and Knowledge Hubs (LKH) aimed at advancing fundamental and technical knowledge to support the implementation of natural climate solutions in Canada.”\n\n\n7.

Key areas\n\nDevelop participatory approaches to identify Shared Socioeconomic  Pathways (SSPs) relevant to the HJBL and link them to local socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (see Szetey et al. 2021 for an example in Australia, Japan Yoshikawa et al. (2022), and Frame et al. (2018) on how to adapt global SSPs for national and local scenarios).\nAdapt global SSPs to national scenarios by downscaling narratives to national and subnational levels, creating similar narratives across scales, and improving regional applicability of SSPs through iterative participatory co-design or co-creation of consistent multi-sector scenarios.\nCo-create regional and local scenarios by weaving multiple knowledge systems and collaborating with multiple partners in identifying their needs and expectations. And, ensure scenarios are consistent across scales (Kurniawan 2020).\nLeverage community-based opportunities (Esmail et al. 2023) and maximize the mutual benefits of cooperation by integrating multiple actors and strategies (O’Bryan et al. 2023).\nBuild decision support through scenario-building led by local communities. For instance: How do fire, climate change, subsidence, drought, permafrost thaw, interact and to affect the region’s biodiversity and the people living there? What are the tipping points and boundaries where we expect big changes to occur?\nIdentify the role of multiple biodiversity and ecosystem services in the HJBL within the narrative of future scenarios (Rosa et al. 2019.)).\nInclude in these scenarios additional drivers of habitat degradation, species extinction risk, declines in the population abundances of species, and shifts in the distribution of species and biomes (Periera et al. 2024).\nEnsure the representation of direct and indirect drivers in scenarios by increasing the resolution (temporal, spatial and thematic) of land-, freshwater-, and coastal-use change, climate change, and other drivers including pollution and invasive species as identified by traditional and Western Science.\n\nCreate working groups to:\n\nEnsure that a weaving multiple knowledge systems is implemented in all tasks and initiatives involved in BON establishment (e.g., identifying needs and expectations from multiple partners working and living in the region on biodiversity, ecosystem services, etc.).\nDeploy state of the art data collection and maintenance, including data as SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC), identify spatial and taxonomic gaps, and tools for the design of sampling schemes (Maslen et al. 2023).\nImplement models for causal attribution of natural and human drivers of biodiversity change and methods for comparison of the evidence supporting alternative causal models (Gonzalez et al. 2023).\nCo-design monitoring schemes and models used for trend detection and attribution with all partners.\n\nSupport and enhance capabilities of the local observatories:\n\nIdentify what resources, technologies and capacities that are already available, and assess what is needed (logistics, training, operational, funding, etc) in terms of the value of information for decision support (Bennett et al. 2018).\n\nDeploy an information system that integrates observations, models and tools into reproducible and open workflows that respect FAIR and CARE principles (e.g. Bon in a Box):\n\nConnect top down with bottom up approaches to biodiversity observations.\nInvite communities to contribute knowledge and indicator monitoring-based assessments.\n\n\n\n2. Exploratory scenarios\n\nThere is a need to integrate regional data sets, not only on climate change, but also on multiple facets of biodiversity change and ecosystem services to scale up results scales relevant to policy (Mori et al. 2021, Stralberg et al. 2015).\nWe can also estimate how changes in biodiversity,  and other landscape metrics of heterogeneity (e.g., habitat heterogeneity), might affect changes in biomass (e.g., Dynamic Habitat Index) and other measures of ecosystem functioning (Isbell et al. 2017, Gonzalez et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n3. Target seeking scenarios\nCoordinating efforts across spatial scales confirms the critical need to evaluate national strategies for reaching global targets (e.g., protecting 30% of Earth’s land by 2030, 30x30) (Eckert et al. 2023).\n\nEvaluating the relative contribution of the HJBL to 30x30 global and national targets is a priority. The Canadian approach developed by Eckert et al. (2023) and its implementation in Quebec (Eckert et al. 2023b) should guide further analyses and alternative scenarios for conservation action.\nScenarios comparing priority areas for biodiversity protection with other 30x30 criteria such as integrity, connectivity (Kukkala and Moilanen 2017, Albert et al. 2027, Carroll et al. (2018), ecosystem services and equitable governance (Franz 2021) should be implemented (Eckert et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\nBack to top"

Purpose of modelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\nPartners should clearly identify the purpose of modelling and match it with their goals, questions and objectives to protect and manage biodiversity and ecosystem services. Modelling can have multiple purposes (for more information see Tredennick et al. (2021) and Geary et al. 2020) , for instance:\n\nExploration: describe patterns in the data and generate hypothesis about nature. For instance, the global dynamic of biomass (Harfort et al. 2014), species richness patterns (Hawkins et al. 2003, Mittelbach et al. 2007, Tietje et al. 2022)\nInference:  evaluate the strength of evidence in a data set for some statement about nature (e.g., Popovic et al. 2024, Santos et al. 2024).\nForecast or hindcast scenarios: make predictions about possible past, future or novel scenarios (e.g., predicitons in ecology: Houlahan et al. 2016). For instance, modelling and assessing disturbance trajectories (e.g., climate change: Carroll et al. 2021, Brown et al. 2015; and, land use and land cover change:  Soterroni et al. 2018 and Soterroni et al. 2019) and/or management regimes (e.g., biodiversity and ecosystem services: Kass et al. 2023, Nelson et al. 2009).\nDecision making in management or intervention actions: evaluate alternative management strategies and interventions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EcoCode working group from GEO BON summarizes multiple stages of modelling.\nModels are needed at every stage of the Biodiversity Monitoring-to-Mitigation pathway, starting from data observation and continuing through to projection and mitigation:\n\nData observation: models are needed that can account for varying sample intensities and methods in order to assess uncertainties accurately. \nBuilding indicators: models are used to aggregate and differentially weight certain observations into aggregated diversity indicators, especially for use in monitoring trends.\nTrend detection: usually, statistical models that accurately account for propagated errors are applied to evaluate trends of biodiversity change through time. \nAttribution: for attributing biodiversity change to specific drivers, models are  required that can represent expected biodiversity patterns with and without focal drivers. These models might take the form of statistical models or mechanistic models parameterized for key processes.\nProjection: biodiversity projections can evaluate the impact of different future social and economic scenarios on future biodiversity – for instance, how different land use and climate change scenarios might affect future biodiversity loss. \nMitigation: projection models can be used to test mitigation options via simulation and also incorporate additional social costs in prioritising mitigation options.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity Modelling as Part of an Observation System (Ferrier et al. 2016)\nBiodiversity modeling advances will improve predictions of nature’s contributions to people (Kass et al. 2024).\nA practical guide to selecting models for exploration, inference, and prediction in ecology (Tredennick et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2. Type of models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3. Scale-Dependence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\nBiophysical and socio-economic variables, as well as, processes and patterns of ecological systems operate and vary as a function of spatial (extent and resolution) and temporal scale (e.g.,Hewitt et al 2017, Zarnetske et al 2019, Madsen & de Silva 2024, Zelnik et al 2023). It is also expected that the response to multiple anthropogenic drivers also vary in space and time (Bastazini et al. 2021), posing a challenge for model integration (Isbell et al. 2017, Weiskopf et al. 2022).\n“The ecological patterns and variability we observe range from millimetres to across ocean basins and from seconds to the expanse of evolutionary history. Patterns apparent at one scale can collapse to noise when viewed from other scales, indicating that perceptions of the importance of different processes vary in a scale-dependent manner” (Hewitt et al 2010).\nLet’s take a look of some figures explaining how variables, patterns and processes vary across spatial and temporal scales:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbiotic variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeodiversity across scales. (a) Examples of geodiversity variables and the spatial and temporal extents at which they vary. Geodiversity encompasses abiotic components of the Earth’s critical zone, specifically the lithosphere (brown), atmosphere (red), hydrosphere (blue) and cryosphere (grey) (Natural Resources Council, 2001; Parks & Mulligan, 2010). In general, surficial geodiversity at regional to global scales remains constant over short time-frames (e.g., days to years), whereas local-scale surficial geodiversity (e.g., micro-topography and the physical and chemical properties of soil) vary over short to intermediate time-frames (e.g., years to centuries). (b) Examples of satellite remotely sensedgeodiversity (black). As point data, biodiversity data (green) are often high resolution, but are lacking in spatial and temporal extent. Networked sites, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites, provide a combination of biodiversity and geodiversity (dark green). See an interactive table with a more complete list of NASA missions and products for geodiversity at: https://bioxgeo.github.io/bioXgeo_ProductsTable/, also in Suporting Information Appendix A. Additional abbreviations are as follows: BBS = Breeding Bird Survey; FIA = forest inventory and analysis; G-LiHT = Goddard’s LiDAR hyperspectral thermal imager; GPM = global precipitation measurement mission; GRACE = gravity recovery and climate experiment; MODIS = MODerate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; SMAP = soil moisture active passive; SRTM = shuttle radar topography mission; TRMM = tropical rainfall measuring mission (Figure from Zarnetske et al 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerrestrial ecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe manner in which space-time domains of entities and concepts relevant to maintaining biological diversity in forests are commonly perceived. (a) components of forests and effects modifying forests. (b) forest dwelling organisms and processes affecting them. (c) concepts related to conserving biological diversity (from Bunnell & Huggard 1999).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarine ecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring across spatiotemporal scales in marine systems. Spatial and temporal scales of marine dynamic and ecosystem processes, and the measurement capabilities of different observational platforms. Dynamic and/or physical processes are represented by black circles and biological and/or ecological processes by green circles. The presence of new autonomous platforms, such as Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats (red line) and gliders and similar unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) (purple line), fill the cross-discipline and cross-scale observational gaps left by traditional observation methods such as remote sensing by satellite (yellow line), moorings (green line) or ship-based observations (blue line). Dashed lines indicate potential extension of an observational network (Chai et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial and ecological processes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial and temporal scales of social processes(bold blue font) and ecological processes (italicized green font) that affect forests, many of which occur on the landscape scale (grey oval). (From Fischer 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem services\n\n\n\n\n\nHow spatial scale shapes the generation and management of multiple ecosystem services (Lindborg et al. 2017)\nUnderstanding relationships among ecosystem services across spatial scales and over time (Qiu et al. 2018).\nNational ecosystem services mapping at multiple scales. The German exemplar (Rabe et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystem services\n\n\n\n\n\nThe supply of multiple ecosystem services requires biodiversity across spatial scales (Le provost et al. 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcological processes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntrophogenic stressors and ecological scales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe align the Living Planet Index (LPI) source-based categories of stressors with a classical view of ecological scales and the target metrics at each scale. The framework (and models, see below) highlights targets and ecological scales that coalesce the impacts of stressors by what they do, not what they are. For example, pollution and climate stressors can both generate direct effects on the abundance of species by killing individuals, but also via trait-mediated effects acting on growth and reproduction. As different ecological scales are connected by higher-order interactions, outputs at higher and lower levels of ecological organization can emerge. Note that we define the effects of a stressor at the individual scale as those that act within, rather than between, individuals. Thus, a harvesting process, such as hunting, can have individual-scale effects by altering stress hormone levels in individuals, which has consequences for demography and therefore the population. However, hunting primarily acts by killing individual animals or plants, which directly affects properties of the population (abundance/biomass) not properties of the individual. Note that this figure is a first attempt designed to illustrate our framework and is by no means comprehensive. (From Simmons et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-evaluating global assessments using local datasets\nFor instance, Dinerstein et al. (2020), identified global areas providing co-benefits by protecting biodiversity and carbon stocks aimed to secure global climate stability (Global Safety Net, GSN). However, Finkelstein et al. (2023) applied the same approach in Ontario (Canada), using local data sets, and found that “when region-specific data are incorporated, Ontario is even more significant than what is shown in the GSN, especially in terms of carbon stocks in forested and open peatlands.”  Zhu et al. (2021) went further and addressed the issue of spatial scales in Asia, arguing that a “framework should be capable of identifying priorities at each scale (regional, biome, and national)”. They proposed “a stepwise approach based on scalable priorities at regional, biome, and national levels that can complement potential Convention on Biological Diversity targets of protecting 30% land in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.” \nIntegrating multiple knowledge systems\nFire regimes characterization using remote sensing (Hanes et al. 2018, Coops et al. 2018) have been used to inform management activities for government agencies (Erni et al. 2019) and along with Indigenous land stewardship have provided tools to advance proactive fire mitigation (Copes et al. 2022).\nDeveloping multi-scale scenarios\nRosa et al. (2017) have proposed a two-step strategy to develop a new generation of scenarios within the IPBES (2016) framework, as follows: ?” (i) extend existing global scenarios developed by the climate-science community, by modelling impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services (Fig. 1a); and (ii) make an ambitious effort to create a set of multiscale scenarios of desirable ‘nature futures’, based on the perspectives of different stakeholders, taking into account goals for both human development and nature stewardship (Fig. 1b).” (See figure here).\nLinking the influence and dependence of people on biodiversity across scales\nIsbell et al. (2017)\n\n\n\n\nMultiscale dependance has been documented widely:\n\nBiophysical processes, identify patterns in nature (e.g., Brian & Catford 2023, Mod et al. 2020, Meng et al. 2023, Wand & Loreau 2014, Spake et al. 2020, Leroy et al. 2023).\nBiodiversity patterns (Hulbert & Jetz 2007, Chase et al. 2018, Jarzyna & Jetz 2018).\nInform decision making to secure the provision of ecosystem services (Andersonn et al. 2015, Lindborg et al. 2017, Liu et al. 2017, Raudsepp-Hearne & Peterson 2016, Le Provost et al. 2023).\nProtection of biodiversity (Ekroos et al 2016, Hurlbert & Jetz 2007, Slabbert et al. 2020, Mayor et al. 2015).\nManagement (Ladouceur et al. 2023, Ekroos et al. 2016).\nInvasive alien species (Kotowska et al. 2022).\nEcosystem services (Qin et al. 2023, Liu et al. 2017, Hein et al. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4. Integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\nTop-down approaches are driven by policy mandates and/or directives, requiring changes in socioeconomic systems (e.g., SDGs and CBDs goals and targets) and designed to force behavioral change through policy.\nBottom-up approaches influence policy through collective behavior (individual actions that can propel massive impact when adopted by communities) and/or motivate research to answer questions at local scales.\nDing et al. (2023)offers a good description of issues emerging the lack of integration between bottom-up and top-down approaches, as follow: Currently, top-down approaches originating from hierarchical government structures [2] have created widespread and immediate conservation mandates and are thus widely applied in large-scale ecological restoration programs [3]. Specifically, a higher-level government (“buyer”), like the central government, sets nationwide ecological restoration goals based on the biophysical processes of land conversion. The lower-level government or local-scale organizations, such as local governments, are tasked with achieving these goals through negotiations with the participants (“seller”), like landowners, to achieve certain conservation mandates [4], [5], [6]. However, spatial mismatches in implementation often occur on a broad scale, where decisions are based on coarse scale information and the local scale, and the implementation of on-the-ground restoration is impacted by resource limitations and social complexity [7], [8], [9]. This mismatch often results in the failure of large-scale restoration planning due to a failure to characterize social–ecological interactions affecting stakeholder behavior during the implementation processes and thus, fails to achieve the desired goals [10], [11]. To minimize implementation conflicts, large-scale restoration planning should incorporate a comprehensive analysis of social–ecological interactions, including socioeconomic constraints, participant willingness [12], [13], and decision-maker preferences [11].\n\n\n\nFigure link and description from Ding et al. (2023) Integrated framework for top-down and bottom-up approaches within social–ecological systems based on a large-scale ecological restoration program. (a) An analytical framework was established to integrate top-down (focusing on ecological characteristics) and bottom-up (considering behaviors of stakeholders) approaches to increase practicality and efficiency of large-scale ecological restoration programs. (b) A three-step bottom-up approach to integrate impacts of stakeholder behaviors from previous fine-scale research into large-scale ecological programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoupling socio-ecological interactions at local levels with large scale planning strategies\nSee Ding et al. (2023)\nCore principles\nEicken et al. (2021) “identify core principles central to such improved links: matching observing program aims, scales, and ability to act on information; matching observing program and community priorities; fostering compatibility in observing methodology and data management; respect of Indigenous intellectual property rights and the implementation of free, prior, and informed consent; creating sufficient organizational support structures; and ensuring sustained community members’ commitment”.\nCodesign, comanagement, and coproduction\n“..the implementation of principles of codesign, comanagement, and coproduction is facilitated greatly by focusing on pressing societal problems at a scale that intersects interests of both local communities in a particular region and large-scale observing efforts” (Eicken et al. 2021 ).\nIntegrating bottom -up and top-down biodiversity metrics\n“Top-down intactness metrics (e.g., Mean Species Abundance) can be valuable for generating high-level or first-tier assessments of impact risk but do not provide sufficient precision or guidance for companies, regulators, or third-party assessors. New metrics based on bottom-up assessments of biodiversity (e.g., the Species Threat Abatement and Restoration metric) can accommodate spatial variation of biodiversity and provide more specific guidance for actions to avoid, reduce, remediate, and compensate for impacts and to identify positive opportunities”….. “The 2 approaches in combination may provide a clear path for businesses to identify the most effective actions to reduce impacts. This will be crucial for compliance with emerging disclosure frameworks, such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (2022), and for setting science-based targets for nature (Science Based Targets, 2023)”. (Hawkins et al 2023).\n\n\n\n\nTop-down approaches are usually the first approximation in model implementation, scenario assessment (e.g., Moss et al. 2010, Meinshause et al. 2020,  and Popp et al. 2017), and tools’ development (e.g., Map of Life, InVEST, GLOBIO-ES).\nFor bottom-up approahces, GLOBIOM is “used to  analyze the competition for land use between agriculture, forestry, and bioenergy, which are the main land-based production sectors. The model is built following a bottom-up setting based on detailed grid-cell information, providing the biophysical and technical cost information”.\nThere is growing interest in evaluating top-down approaches with local and regional data sets (Siabi et al. 2023), economic sectors (Calheiros et al. 2023), and integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches (Ding et al. 2022, Eicken et al. 2021) .\nLynam et al. (2016) show the interaction between top-down and bottom-up control in marine food webs; and, Gaymer et al. (2014) show key lessons in integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches to stakeholder and community engagement in the planning and implementation of marine protected areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5. Complexity of interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\nRiva et al. (2023) for complexity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrivers of biodiversity\nBiodiversity facets interacting at multiple scales\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystem functions (Pasari et al. 2013)\nBiodiversity and productivity (Qiao et al. 2021)\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystem services\n\n(Mace et al. 2012, Le Provost et al. 2022)\n\nBiodiversity responding to multiple drivers\n\nBiodiversity and climate change (e.g., Shivanna 2022)\nBiodiversity and land cover and land use change\nBiodiversity and CC+LCLUC\n\nBiodiversity loss and its effects on ecosystem (services) stability\n\n(see McCann 2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5. Integrating multiple models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\nAny region in the world is a complex mix of biophysical, socioeconomic and cultural systems, interacting at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Models can capture some aspect of a particular system, for instance predicting plant biomass accumulation (e.g., Chen et al. 2018), prediciting species distributions (Pinto & Cavender 2021), identifying areas of vulnerability to climate change (Carroll et al. 2015) or predicting species’ range shifts under climate change (Antão et al. 2022).\nCombining models can provide more insights on the phenomenon under study and capture the strength of each model within the pool of models. Moreover, combining models from different systems might provide a more accurate assessment of the interactions of these systems by capturing multi-partners needs and expectations, integrating multiple features of the biophysical and socio-economic systems and assessing multiple scenarios. For instance, co-benefits of biodiversity and carbon storage have been recently explored (Soto-Navarro et al. (2020), Dinerstein et al. (2020), Finkelstein et al. (2023) and Zhu et al. (2021) and Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are spatially explicit and mathematical models, usually global in scope, sector oriented (e.g., Krey 2014) and originally designed to evaluate climate change scenarios (e.g., SSPs, IPCC 2021, FurhmaN et al. 2019) and SDGs (van Soest et al. 2019). \n\n\n\n\nIntegrating facets within systems (e.g., Biodiversity facets)\nCoupling models and tools\nSome analyses require coupling several models to accomplish their objectives. For instance,\n\nprojecting land cover and land use change (LCLUC) to assess ecosystem services under multiple scenarios requires coupling Multi-Objective Programming (MOP) to  optimized solutions for each land use type subject to a series of constraints specified by a given scenario  and the Dynamic Conversion of Land Use and its Effects (Dyna-CLUE) to allocate the predicted land use changes to grid cells following a bottom-up process (Wang et al. 2018).\nLi et al. (2023) have used the “Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) to assess the features of land utilization conversion and forecasted land utilization under three development patterns in 2030” and then the “InVEST model to estimate changes in carbon storage trends under three development scenarios in 2000, 2010, 2020, and 2030 and the impact of socioeconomic and natural factors on carbon storage”. \n\nThere are also strategies to ensemble models to reduce uncertainty. For instance, Hooftman et al. (2022) and Willcock et al (2023) evaluated the effect of ensemble models to reduce certainty gaps in spatially explicit ecosystem services. (e.g,  using multiple ecosystem accounting platforms such as InVEST, ARIES, and Co$tingNature).\nStralberg et al. (2015) used multiple GCMs projections and SDMs to evaluate signal vs. noise in the response of bird abundance to climate change. They found that for 58% of 80 boreal songbird species over the next 30 years—increasing to 88% of species by the end of the century—the climate change “signal” in projections of abundance was greater than the “noise” generated by uncertainty due to a combination of sampling error, variable selection, and choice of global climate model (GCM)” (Stralberg et al. 2015).\nWeiskopf et al. (2022)\nCross-sectoral integration\nFrieler et al. (2015)\nIntegrated Assessment Models (IAMs)\nModel integration seems to offer a pathway to understand complex systems and inform decision making. However, current models are global, make multiple assumptions and can generate high spatial and temporal uncertainty. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have been developed to respond to this need of integration. Originally, IAMs were developed to evaluate multiple scenarios of climate change, mainly focused on economic sectors (e.g., energy) aimed to inform alternative policies in GHG emissions reduction.  Recently, they have been extended to other sectors and customized to include land cover and land use change, and some biodiversity facets and ecosystem services, as well. However, their implementation is limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6. Coupled Model Intercomparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is it?How has it been addressed?Some examples\n\n\n\n“Model intercomparisons bring together different communities of practice for comparable and complementary modeling, in order to improve the comprehensiveness of the subject modeled, and to estimate uncertainties associated with scenarios and models (Frieler et al., 2015)” (Kim et al. 2018)\n\n\n\n\nIntercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (BES-SIM)\n“The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land-use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e., nature’s contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models” (Kim et al. 2018) .\nModel intercomparison across multiple scales\n“Mechanistic and process-based model intercomparisons can act as a platform for systematically testing the performance of different encoded mechanisms and processes across scales not considered during model development. For instance, intercomparisons could determine whether existing mechanistic IBMs designed at the field scale can predict meta-population dynamics across isolated habitat patches at the landscape scale, or whether process-based MCMs can predict local species population dynamics” (Johnston et al. 2024).\n\n\n\nExample systematic model intercomparison framework for testing existing mechanistic and process-based ecological models (a, d, g, j) across multiple spatiotemporal scales (b, e, h, k) and levels of biological organization (c, f, i, l). This example illustrates a comparison between an energy budget IBM (a) developed at the field scale (b) to predict population dynamics (c), dispersal kernel metapopulation model (d) to predict landscape-scale (e) meta-population dynamics (f), metacommunity model with species-specific population growth rates (r) across abiotic gradients (g) and pairwise interaction strengths to predict regional-scale (h) species interaction networks (i) and trophic ecosystem model (j) to predict national to global (k) community dynamics (l). All existing models would be simulated at each scale and model predictions compared to multiple empirical patterns at different levels of biological organization according to a standardized pattern-oriented modelling (POM) evaluation procedure (m) and computational tractability monitored, for example according to computer processing unit (CPU) time across scales (n). Model comparisons (m, n) would provide valuable information about important mechanisms and processes at specific scales and act as a platform for cross-scale ecological modelling, for example by comparing alternative ensemble models (grey line in m, n) that address scale-explicit model constraints. (Form Johnston et al. 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCouple Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)\nCMIP is a framework for climate models to analise, validate and improve Global Circulation Models (GCMs).\n\nIt is “coupled” because all the climate models are coupled atmosphere and ocean GCMS.\nIt is “intercomparison” because CMIP brings together and into line all climate models from multiple modelling centres.\nmultiple generations of CMIP have been developed (see more here and PCMDI)\n\n“Global coupled climate models are elaborate numerical/physical formulations of the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land which are”coupled” together and interact to simulate the three-dimensional distribution of the climate over the globe” (Meehl et al. 2011).\nThe CMIP6 multi-model ensembles of temperature and precipitation, near-surface wind speed, sea ice concentration, sea ice thickness, and snow depth for each Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP).\nSee a description in the Government of Canada webs\nBiodiversity facets\nThe EcoCode working group from GEO BON wants to create a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project among biodiversity models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA non-exhaustive list of models & Tools!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do:\n\nReview this for additional models: EcoService Models Library (ESML)\nFor abiotic data sets review this: Geodiversity Data Products\n\n\n\n\nBack to top"

New metrics based on bottom-up assessments of biodiversity (e.g., the Species Threat Abatement and Restoration metric) can accommodate spatial variation of biodiversity and provide more specific guidance for actions to avoid, reduce, remediate, and compensate for impacts and to identify positive opportunities”….. “The 2 approaches in combination may provide a clear path for businesses to identify the most effective actions to reduce impacts. This will be crucial for compliance with emerging disclosure frameworks, such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (2022), and for setting science-based targets for nature (Science Based Targets, 2023)”.

The weight of the Laurentide ice sheet, centered over Hudson Bay, depressed the surface of the land. Then, as the ice sheets melted at the end of the ice age, the land started to rebound—a process that continues today (Fyon 2020, NASA). \nIsostatic rebound (i.e., the rise of land masses that were depressed by the huge weight of ice sheets during the last ice age (NSIDC) is causing the southern coast of Hudson Bay coast in Ontario to rise at about 1 to 1.3 meters per hundred years, creating about 3 km of new land every 100 years (Fyon 2020). \n\n\n\nThe lines of raised beaches located far away from the present-day coasts of Hudson Bay and James Bay are one of the most powerful visual reminders that the land has risen, and continues to rise, since the end of the last great ice age about 8000 years ago” Fyon (2020).\n\n\nPermafrost, perennial frozen ground or soil or rock with continuous temperatures below 0°C, are also predominant in the northern part of the region.

The wetlands of the HJBL\nHJBL is a complex and dynamic landscape, a patchwork dominated by shallow coastal bays, spruce-lichen woodlands, and wetlands including “open and forested bogs and peat plateaus; flat fen meadows, and stringed and palsa fens; and swamps, marsh, and open water” (Dredge and Dyke 2020). \nThe isostatic rebound has resulted in “a chronosequence of basal peat ages with the oldest peatlands furthest from the coastline” (Packalen et al. 2014). Most wetlands undergo shifts in vegetation type over long timescales; a diverse suite of successional trajectories have been identified for HJBL peatlands. Some sites show classic shifts from marsh to rich fen to poor fen, followed by fen-to-bog transitions (Glaser et al. 2004a; Glaser et al. 2004b, Klinger and Short, 1996) while others show shifts from forested peatlands to open bogs, or marshes to rich fens, which persist for millennia (O’Reilly et al., 2014). \nEach wetland type or successional stage is characterized by distinct processes in terms of carbon uptake and methane (CH4) release (Treat et al. 2021); thus, better tracking the role of vegetation community on long-term rates of carbon accumulation and net carbon balance is an emerging research priority (Mathijssen et al. 2019)” (Da Silva et al. 2022; see also Warner and Asada 2005, Minns et al. 2008). \nThe extensive wetlands of the region offer multiple ecosystem services of global and regional significance, including carbon cycling and climate regulation, freshwater supply, water provision, water storage, water retention, water quality, biodiversity maintenance (Keddy et al. 2009), and providing traditional food to indigenous and local communities from multiple species in the region, among others (Tarnocai et al. 2011, FAO-UN (2020), Harris et al. 2021). Peatland restoration and conservation is a critical nature based solution to global and regional climate and biodiversity challenges (Bonn et al. 2016)."

    "text": "7. Threats, risks, and instabilities\nThe HJBL region has a low human footprint (Venter et al. 2016, Hirsh-Pearson et al. 2022, Watson et al. 2023, Allan et al. 2017). Some metrics characterize this region as having high ecosystem integrity (Hill et al. 2022), high forest intactness, and ecological connectivity (Grantham et al. 2020). Although numerous waterways of the James Bay watershed have been modified with dams or diversion for major hydroelectric projects, many river basins are characterized by free-flowing rivers (i.e., high connectivity, see Grill et al. 2019), and the wetlands are in a relatively stable condition (Wulder et al. 2018).\n\n\n\nHuman footprintHirsh-Pearson et al. (2022), main rivers (HydroRIVERS) and lakes (HydroLAKES).\n\n\nAlthough some waterways of the HJBL watershed have been modified by human-made structures, most of the river basins are classified as free-flowing rivers (i.e., high connectivity, see Grill et al. 2019), and the wetlands are in a relatively stable condition (Wulder et al. 2018).\n\n\n\nRivers’ Connectivity Status Index for Canada, developed by Confluvio (2020)\n\n\nDetecting and understanding natural drivers of change in the HJBL must be accompanied by knowledge of how human drivers are causing unexpected changes in different facets of the region’s biodiversity and ecosystem processes and over different temporal and spatial scales. \nMultiple drivers are acting on the HJBL. Global climate warming along with land use change due to varied human activities are major threats to these ecosystems that are expected to increase in prominence and impact in the coming decade. Harris et al. (2021) summarized major threats to peatlands.\n(see Abraham et al. (2010) and Ocean North (2021) for a review of status and trends assessment in the region).\nClimate change\nCanada’s landscapes are experiencing the effects of climate change. These effects include the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) due to permafrost thaw, shifts in vegetation ecotones and species composition, and increases in tree mortality from drought, wildfire, and insect outbreaks (Drever et al. 2021).\n“Approximately 60% of the total area of Canadian peatlands and 51% of the organic carbon mass in all Canadian peatlands are expected to be severely to extremely severely affected by climate change” (Tarnocai 2006).\n\n\n\nPeatland sensitivity to climate change (Tarnocai 2006).\n\n\n“Northern peatlands have cooled the global climate for thousands of years by continuously and persistently removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it in deep peat soils, where it has remained for close to 10,000 years. Degradation of this long-term carbon sink releases large quantities of stored carbon to the atmosphere and therefore has the potential to have a major impact on global climate. Peatland C losses from land use change, fires, drainage, and thawing permafrost – are effectively irrecoverable, since carbon in northern peatlands accumulates slowly and recovers on the order of decades and centuries, but not on the timescale of 2030 or 2050 climate targets” (WCS 2021).\nNatural climate solutions (NCS) are at the heart of Canada’s contributions to goals for emission reductions (e.g., Smith 2020). Yet, “approximately 60% of the total area of Canadian peatlands and 51% of the organic carbon mass in all Canadian peatlands are expected to be severely to extremely severely affected by climate change” (Tarnocai 2006). \nThe increase of temperatures over continental and ocean regions poses a lot of risks globally and for all biophysical components, ecosystem services and challenges for people living in the HJBL and northern regions in Canada (Tarnocai 2006, McLaughlin and Webster 2018, McLaughlin & Packalen 2021, Tam et al. 2013, Tan et al. 2020, Dyke & Sladen 2009, Morison et al. 2023, Pörtner et al. 2023).  Moreover, the potential impacts and how they will play out is one of the key current science questions. Shrubification, longer growing seasons, the likely persistence of a humid climate even with warming in the areas adjacent to HJBL, make this calculation complex. For instance, Gallego-Sala et al. (2018) reported higher rates of peat carbon accumulation during the Holocene Thermal Maximum and the Medieval Warm Period. Chaudhary et a. (2020) reported that “rapid global warming could reduce the carbon sink capacity of the northern peatlands in the coming decades”. And, Qiu et al. (2022) estimated that “Northern peatlands are projected to be climate neutral until the year 2300 under RCP2.6. In contrast, under RCP8.5, CO2 and CH4 emissions by northern peatlands could exacerbate global warming by 0.21C (0.09–0.49C) by 2300”.\nLand-cover and land-use change (LCLUC)\nLand-cover and Land-use change (LCLUC), along with climate change, is one of the major global drivers of biodiversity loss (Newbold et al. 2015, Powers & Jetz 2019), habitat degradation worldwide, and ecosystem change (Hooper et al. 2012).\nAlthough the entire HJBL has a low human footprint (Venter et al. 2016, Hirsh-Pearson et al. 2022) major development activities modifying the landscape are expected in the region. Mining development is one of them (gc, ring of fire, MLAS, Sonter et al. 2018, see WCS story maps), creating also multiple expectations with Indigenous Peoples and local communities (e.g., mining conflicts with first nations, Mining conflicts, and Canada’s critical minerals strategy). Winter access to the region is a current alternative, using winter trails and/or winter roads facilitated by permafrost. Climate change might affect winter roads viability and longevity in Far North regions (Hori et al. 2016). New roads for mining development are also expected in the region. \n\n\n\nMining claims and proposed roads in the HJBL. Source Canadian Geographic-Chris Brackley 2023.\n\n\n“If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries” (Humpenöder et al. 2020). “Almost half (45%) of the peatland area in the Nordic and Baltic States have been drained and emit almost 80 megatons of CO2 annually, i.e. 25% of the total CO2 emissions of these countries” (Joosten 2015).\n“Of particular concern is”irrecoverable C”, or peatland C stocks lost through land conversion that cannot recover by 2050, as required for net-zero global CO2 emissions (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2018; Goldstein et al. 2020).” Avoided conversion of peatland and improved forest management offer the largest climate change mitigation opportunities (Drever et al. 2021). Protecting large and continuous areas in the HJBL will offer multiple global, national and local co-benefits (e.g., biodiversity, carbon storage, Di Marco et al. 2019). Strack et al. (2019) also reported that LCLUC (e.g., petroleum exploration) can increase methane emissions, resulting in a 7-8% increase in GHG emissions currently reported. \nChanging fire regimes\nChanges in frequency and intensity of fire regimes are expected to emerge in Canada and the HJBL this century (Hanes et al. 2018,  Kendra et al. 2020, Coops et al. 2018, Kelly et al. 2023, Canadian Wildland Fire Information System). The HJBL will be exposed to these shifts in fire regimes (the fires of 2023 offer anecdotal evidence of the changing risks and consequences for the HJBL). Fires burning peatland will alter carbon fluxes and stocks. Paleo-record supports the view that higher fire frequencies will likely weaken the capacity of some northern peatlands to be net carbon sinks in the future” (Davies et al. 2023). Wilkinson et al. (2023) found that “wildfire processes reduced carbon uptake in pristine peatlands by 35% and further enhanced emissions from degraded peatlands by 10%”. And also, “climate change impacts accelerated carbon losses, where increased burn severity and burn rate reduced the carbon sink by 38% and 65%, respectively, by 2100” (Wilkinson et al. 2023).\nSee interactive map from Canada Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS)\nHowever, more information is needed to understand how much of the peatland will burn. In some regions to the east, the peatlands burn less often. There is a potential for this region to act as a refuge compared to the peatlands and boreal shields in the west, which are burning more frequently due to drought, climate change, and development. Also, historically Indigenous stewardship of the land included managed fire and controlled burns, which reduced fire severity (e.g., Miller et al. 2010, Nikolakis & Roberts 2020). Wildfire is a major driver of recent permafrost thaw in boreal peatlands (Gibson et al. (2018).\nPermafrost thaw\nAlthough permafrost is very limited in extent in the HJBL region; however where it is present it is highly vulnerable to thawing (Spence et al. 2020). Rapid thawing can accelerate carbon release (Turestky et al. 2019, IPCC 2019) and contribute to decreasing the Peat-C accumulation rate of the entire pan-Arctic region (Zhao et al. 2022). McLaughlin and Webster (2013) describe the potential climate change effects on peatland carbon in the HJBL, as follow: “(1) in northern ecoregions accelerated permafrost thawing and wetter peat enhances methane emissions and (2) in southern ecoregions increased evapotranspiration and drier peat accelerates carbon dioxide losses through peat decomposition (and possible fire).” When drained or burned for agriculture (as wetlands often are) they go from being a carbon sink to a carbon source, releasing into the atmosphere centuries of stored carbon (UN Environment programme).  \n\n\n\nPermafrost thawing (Turestky et al. 2019)\n\n\nThe effect of these drivers will affect biophysical features in the region, including hydrological feedbacks in northern peatlands (Waddington et al. (2014), changes in wildfire regimes, droughts, the ability of these areas to support plant growth (Conradi et al. 2023), exacerbate the decline of wilderness areas (Watson et al. 2016) and associated biota (Desforges et al. 2022), and ecosystem services (e.g., Tomscha et al. 2019). Mack et al. (2023)  “found that permafrost peatlands declined by 4%, 8.5%, and 2% areal in the sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost zones, respectively”.\nInvasive species\nThe region is exposed to the arrival of invasive species in the marine, freshwater and terrestrial realms (Goldsmith et al. 2021, Kent et al. 2018). An official document from the Ontario government reports there were no documented records of alien or invasive species in the provincial parks and conservation reserves in the HJBL (they noted also that “lack of records does necessarily mean alien and invasive species are absent from a provincial park or conservation reserve”); however, the Ontario Shield Ecozone in the south reports 74 provincial parks and 18 conservation reserves with the presence of alien/invasive plants (Ontario Parks 2021). Six species were identified as a high priority for management  including: European Common Reed (Invasive Phragmites), Garlic Mustard, Giant Hogweed and Wild Parsnip, European Water Chestnut, and Japanese Stiltgrass (Ontario Parks 2021). Additional sources of information are: The invasive alien plants in Canada report (CFIA 2008), aquatic invasive species (DFO), The invasive Species Centre, The Ontario’s Invading Species Awareness Program, Invasive species in Ontario, Manitoba Aquatic Invasive Species, Quebec Fish,  Quebec plants, and the EDDMapS mapping system.\nBack to top"

    "text": "5. Peatlands\nAccording to the International Peatland Society: “Peatlands are terrestrial wetland ecosystems in which waterlogged conditions prevent plant material from fully decomposing. Consequently, the production of organic matter exceeds its decomposition, which results in a net accumulation of peat. In cool climates, peatland vegetation is mostly made up of Sphagnum mosses, sedges and shrubs and are the primary builder of peat,….” (International Peatland Society). \n“‘Peatland’ is a general term for land with a naturally accumulated layer of peat near the surface” (UNEP 2022).\n“Peat is dead and partially decomposed plant remains that have accumulated in situ under waterlogged conditions. Peatlands are landscapes with a peat deposit that may currently support a vegetation that is peat-forming, may not, or may lack vegetation entirely. The presence of peat or vegetation capable of forming peat is the key characteristic of peatlands” (COP8 Resolution VIII.17). \nPoor drainage and successive accumulation of peat in the long term have resulted in the formation of vast areas of peatlands in the northern landscapes for millennia (Treat et al. 2018, Da Silva et al. 2022). “Peatlands are an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle, as long-term atmospheric C dioxide (CO2) sinks and methane (CH4) sources” (Packalen et al. 2014). Climate, hydrological, geomorphological, and chemical processes drive regular peatland patterns over a regional scale in the HJBL (Macleod et al. (2017); Mahddiyasa et al. (2023), Wang 2022).  \nOnly 3% of the planet’s terrestrial surface area is made up of peatlands.\n\n\n\nDistribution of peatlands worldwide (PETMAP, Xu et al. 2018)\n\n\n“The Canadian soils store 306 (±147, 90% confidence interval) Pg organic C in the top 1m, 98 Pg C of which are stored in peatlands, confirming that the soil organic C dominates terrestrial carbon stocks in Canada” (Sothe et al. 2022).  \n“The Hudson Plain ecozone, with an area of ~349,000 km2, alone stores 38 Pg C in the first meter depth with an average of 109 kg m−2 and 74 Pg C at 0–2 m depth”  (Sothe et al. 2022).\nCanada harbors around 25% of the world’s peatlands and the largest peatland carbon stock (Harries et al. 2021, Sothe et al. 2022). It offers global regulating ecosystem services such as global climate stability.\nSee interactive storymaps of Northern Peatlands in Canada from WCS.\nBack to top"

    "text": "4. Guidance for action\nModel planning\nDeploy a suite of interactive and user-focused of models and tools for biodiversity and ecosystem services based on the Toolbox presented in this website. Existing tools and initiatives can inspire the design and structure of an operational system in the HJBL (e.g., PERSEUS, CCADI, CreeGeo Hub, Bon in a Box).\nIdentify spatial conservation priorities using traditional knowledge (e.g., Noble et al. 2020). A participatory process with multiple partners should identify the main questions and expectations, potential scenarios, and multi-objectives for the HJBL. This will guide models and tool selection, as well as data sets needed.\nModel implementation\nStart with exploratory analysis (e.g.,  an assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services change in the region, see Dang et al. 2020) and then develop more complex causal models and scenarios to support spatial planning and prioritization. Use time-series observations across spatial location to guide the calibration and validation of biodiversity and ecosystem services models.\nModel integration\nThere is a need to develop existing models to provide robust predictions for biodiversity ( e.g., Weiskopf et al. 2022, Hill et al. 2016) and nature’s contribution to people (Kass et al. 2024). Some of the key actions should include:\n\nIdentify the scales at which different processes operate and operationalize models to capture these scale-specific processes explicitly (e.g. dispersal, flows of water).\nIntegrate modeling and monitoring data (see some guidelines from Honrado et al. 2016) ; the SCALES project offer a relevant methodological approach).\nExpand models to include multiple dimensions of biodiversity (e.g., genetic diversity) and ecosystem services (e.g., cultural services) simultaneously.\nIntegrate of top-down and bottom-up approaches (e.g., biodiversity models (Pollock et al. 2020); global environmental assessments (Pereira et al. 2021), wildlife management (Gandiwa et al. 2013),  ecosystem services (Sieben et al. 2018), climate adaptation (Girard et al. 2014, Pulido et al. 2022, ), and assessing prioritization scenarios to protect biodiversity (Eckert et al. 2022). \nIntegrate biodiversity, ecosystem function, and ecosystem services. For instance, (Isbell et al. 2017, Weiskopf et al. 2021) suggested using the following:\n\nempirical data on biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships to link biodiversity model output directly to ecosystem services models (Mori et al. 2021).\nnetwork models to assess joining sustainability of biodiversity and ecosystem services at local to regionals scales (Gonzalez et al. 2017).\nOperationalize methods and tools available for multi-objective conservation planning that can be applied in the HJBL (see next sections), including addressing spatially-explicit uncertainties in all stages of the process (e.g., data inputs, predictions, etc.) (Kim et al. 2018, Geary et al. 2020, Myers et al. 2021)."

    "text": "9. Guidance for action\nEcosystems of the HJBL are heavily influenced by the presence and flows of water that is critical to the vitality of the wildlife and benefits people derive from these ecosystems.\nPeatlands\nIt is vitally important to protect and restore peatland, rather than to drain them for other human activities (Tarigan et al. 2021, Beaury et al. 2024). Conserving the undisturbed peatlands of the region will avoid additional GHG emissions (Strack et al. 2022), thereby contributing to global climate targets (Convention on wetlands 2024). \nWater and biodiversity are both integral to peatland function so therefore we must also consider how these facets interact when conserving peatlands (Farrell et al. 2022).\nWetlands\nReconcile global conservation priorities for wetlands (see Yi et al. 2024) and national, regional and HJBL priorities.\nSimulate the spatio-temporal dynamics of wetlands to identify regional differences in HJBL by using:\n\nInclude climate change scenarios.\nCombine models with monitoring and assessments of wetland status Jafarzadeh et al. (2022). \n\nLakes\nDevelop multi-temporal water surface areas based on remote sensing imagery to quantify lake-water dynamics (Shi et al. 2021). This will provide a proxy for lake water provisioning in the HJBL that can be summarized using hierarchical hydrobasins and/or integrated in the spatial prioritization. This will also help provide a baseline for a monitoring program, providing early warnings for lake water levels and quality (Hanly et al. 2024).\nCoastal interface\nPotential for changing sea level might affect coastal ecosystems along the HJBL. This is a knowledge gap we recommend for review. \nCarbon storage and management\nVital long-term carbon management strategies in the HJBL, include (Harris et al. (2021): land protection and Indigenous stewardship, regulatory tools for impact assessment, financial incentives, implement GHG reporting and climate models, and develop an integrated framework for peatland protection in Canada.\nThere is an opportunity to model carbon storage pools under multiple scenarios (land cover/land use change and climate change) within the HJBL region, and assess trade-offs with other ecosystem services.\nThere is a need to optimize monitoring/sampling in the region by identifying priority sites where data is needed to improve model performance and reduce uncertainty. Partnerships with local NGOs, universities/researchers, and indigenous communities are needed to support the implementation of an observing system.\nWater\nWater is critical to peatland ecosystem functioning. A number of ecosystem services relating to water should be modeled and assessed: \n\nWater storage and flows (pluvial and fluvial)\n\n\n\nWater for biodiversity (life systems)\nWater for people (drinking)\nFlood alleviation / mitigation\nSediment trapping\n\nBiodiversity\nRecommendations to understand and project the future state of biodiversity:\n\nRefine and validate existing species distribution models for the biodiversity of the region.\nCollate all biodiversity information for the region and make it available on Canadensys and Biodiversité Quebec.\n\n\n\nCreate a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project among biodiversity models.\nSynthesize predictions that will inform the Monitoring-to-Mitigation Pathway.\nCreate a Knowledge-to-Action Hub for co-development of models with stakeholders.\nIdentify key information needed to move from knowledge to action in conservation planning (e.g., Buxton et al. 2021) and lessons learned, management practices, policies, etc., from other countries with considerable peatland coverage are worth considering (e.g., Ireland, OPERAs).\n\nSocio-ecological networks approaches can evaluate how different types of governance affect the supply, demand and flow of multiple ecosystem services (Metzger et al. 2020, UNDP 2017).\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA, i.e., detection of traces of organisms’ DNA in environmental samples) can be used to monitor biodiversity in river networks and within a hierarchical sub-basins and basins structure  (Carraro et al. 2020, 2020b, 2023, Turner et al. 2023), including freshwater fisheries and other ES (Bernos et al. 2023, Heuertz et al. 2023). \nMonitoring the status and trends of genetic diversity using genetic indicators, multiple species relevant for local communities are key to inform policy and report national and global targets (see Hoban et al. (2023). Maps of genetic diversity for the HJBL would provide insight into adaptive potential (Bishop et al. 2023)."
